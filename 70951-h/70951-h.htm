<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p>More than ten years ago when I began teaching hygiene in
the Palmer School of Chiropractic, I realized the need of a
text-book that would deal with this subject from a chiropractic
standpoint.</p>

<p>Many points maintained by hygienists are not in accord
with the teaching of Chiropractic, since they are proven untrue
by our philosophy. For this reason much subject matter in
such text-books was of no value to our students; hence the
necessity for a chiropractic hygiene text.</p>

<p>It has been no easy task to prepare this subject matter in
view of the conflicting teachings and ideas pertaining to the
various phases of hygiene, but the principles of Chiropractic
are in no way compromised and the student, from a casual
perusal of any one particular phase of the subject, should not
draw conclusions that any medical theories of dis-ease are
being tolerated.</p>

<p>An effort has been made to include only that part of hygiene
pertaining to our science. Since sanitation pertains especially
to the environment, the approach to its study is the same
regardless of the viewpoint from which it is considered.</p>

<p>Section II, dealing with the care of the infant and the
adjusting of children, has been written in response to the
hundreds of inquiries which have come in from the practicing
chiropractors in the field requesting such a work. This is not
intended as an exhaustive study in the care of the infant; its
purpose is merely to give a general understanding to those
who are interested in adjusting babies.</p>

<p>The technic used in adjusting children is of great importance
and is so considered.</p>

<p>It is sincerely hoped that this hygiene will fill the long-felt
need on the part of our Faculty for such a text, and
that pediatrics considered chiropractically will be of assistance
to those in the field who have requested a work on this subject.</p>

<p class="center no-indent">CHAPTER I</p>

<p class="center no-indent bold">INTRODUCTION</p>
</div>

<h3>Origin of the Word Hygiene</h3>

<p>Hygeia was the name given the Greek goddess of health.
In her statues she was always represented as a woman of
perfect health and beauty, and was worshipped as the goddess
of health. She was supposed to be the daughter of Esculapius,
the god of medicine. In Greek mythology Esculapius attained
great fame as a physician, having power not only to prevent
dis-ease, but also to raise the dead. A temple was erected
to Hygeia near that of her father. Here the people came to
worship. There was even a statue of Hygeia in the temple
of her father. Thus we see, from time immemorial, health
and medicine have been associated.</p>


<h3>Hygiene Defined</h3>

<p>From the word Hygeia we get the word hygiene, which
means health. Hygiene is defined as the science and the art of
promoting health; the science of the preservation of human
health by the removal of the cause of dis-ease. It is sometimes
defined as the science of health. Hygiene is divided
into two classes, personal and public.</p>

<p><b>Personal Hygiene</b> is the science of the promotion of the
individual’s health and deals with personal habits, such as
eating and drinking; personal cleanliness; personal activities
such as work, recreation, self-restraint. The handling of
children comes under this branch of hygiene. The human<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
machine is limited by the limitations of the physical, which
necessitates the observance of these laws governing the
expression of life.</p>

<p><b>Public Hygiene</b> deals with the methods and processes
necessary to preserve and promote the health interests of
the public. It deals with man collectively rather than individually.
This includes consideration of the environment,
such as cleaning of streets, disposal of the dead, and proper
hygienic methods in buildings and in public places.</p>


<h3>Sanitary Science</h3>

<p>Sanitary science includes the sum total of the knowledge
of those principles and processes necessary to maintain personal
and public health. It is an inductive science and therefore
depends upon observation and verification in determining
the general laws and truths of health and the relation between
cause and effect in public and personal health.</p>


<h3>Sanitary Art</h3>

<p>Sanitary art is the practical application of those principles
which are necessary to create a proper environment for man
in his present artificial state of living, not only for the individual,
but for the public as well.</p>


<h3>Distinction between Sanitation and Hygiene</h3>

<p>The term sanitation or sanitary science is often used
synonymous with the term hygiene although there is a difference
in their meaning and usage. The term sanitation or
sanitary science has been used largely in Great Britain and in
this country, although both terms are used in America but
with somewhat different meanings.</p>

<p>In reality there is a very important distinction between
the two terms hygiene and sanitation. Hygiene may be considered
the broader term which may be made to include
everything relating to health, but more particularly those
things which relate to the person. Sanitation or sanitary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
science relates more to the environmental conditions and
their relation to the health of the individual or the community.</p>

<p>This distinction is drawn more sharply by reason of the
developments along the line of sanitary engineering on the
one hand and the biological and physiological developments
on the other.</p>

<p>Sanitary science has been largely under the supervision
and in the hands of sanitary engineers, while hygiene has been
almost entirely in the hands of the medical profession.</p>


<h3>Aim and Function of Hygiene and Sanitation</h3>

<p>Medically the aim and function of hygiene is to increase
the internal resistance of the individual and thus prevent
dis-ease and prolong life. The aim and function of sanitation
or sanitary science is to improve the environmental conditions
and thus prevent dis-ease and prolong life of the
individual.</p>

<p>Doctor Price gives the aim and function of hygiene as:
“The prevention of dis-ease, the prevention of premature
death, and the promotion of normal health of individuals
and the community by the removal of the causes of dis-ease,
destruction of the causes, improvement of the environmental
conditions, and by the increase of the vital resistance of the
individual and members of communities.” The premise here
is correct, but the conclusions as to the methods which are
to be used in accomplishing the desired end are erroneous.</p>


<h3>Internal and External Cleanliness</h3>

<p>There is a distinction between internal cleanliness and
external cleanliness. It is a mistaken idea that because the
external is clean, the internal will be correspondingly clean.
Cleanliness is absolutely essential to health, but by this we
mean internal cleanliness. There must be external cleanliness
also, but perfect external cleanliness will not necessarily result
in perfect health.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>Vital resistance of the body is not determined by the
degree of external cleanliness nor by the perfect sanitary condition
of the environment. However, it can never be said that
Chiropractic does not believe in cleanliness. Chiropractic, of
all the sciences, lays great stress on hygiene and sanitation.
Our greatest teacher in all things is Nature and if there is
any one thing that Chiropractic insists upon more than any
other, it is that we live according to the laws of Nature and
the closer we live to Nature, the more normal will be our
functions. When we study the laws of Nature, we find the
secret of sanitation. Everywhere in Nature we find laws in
operation which result in the destruction of waste material
and in the purification of the environment.</p>

<p>From the standpoint of common decency we are interested
in sanitation or cleanliness, yet an immaculately clean environment
will not result in perfect health or in the cure of
dis-ease. The streets and alleys of the city may be kept clean
and in a sanitary condition, yet the inside of the homes may
be filled with filth. So the environment of man may be in
a perfect condition so far as sanitation is concerned, yet the
body may be filled with all kinds of poison and refuse.</p>


<h3>Sewerage System of the Body</h3>

<p>The human body is a machine which performs certain
functions and in order that these functions be performed there
is a constant process of activity; this means that the tissues
which make up the body are being constantly worn out the
same as the part of any other machine. This necessitates a
constant process of repair.</p>

<p>In order that this process of reparation be carried on, new
material must be added to the machine; this is done by means
of food. The food is taken into the mouth and properly masticated
and mixed with the secretions of the glands of the
mouth; it is then carried through the esophagus into the
stomach. Here other digestive juices are added to it and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
thoroughly mixed by the vermicular motion of the stomach
until the process of gastric digestion is completed; then this
chyme, as it is now called, passes into the small intestines,
where other secretions are added and chemical changes are
brought about until this process of intestinal digestion is
completed. This product is given the name of chyle.</p>

<p>During the time these processes have been going on, the
process of absorption has been taking place whereby this
digested food has been utilized in building up the tissue cells
that are being constantly worn out by the activities of the
body. The digested products are being taken up by the serous
circulation and carried to every cell in the body. That which
one cell gives off as an elimination, another may take up as
food, finding just the chemical composition necessary to its
life and development. Finally all of the waste material is
collected and eliminated from the body through the organs
of elimination. Innate Intelligence has provided a wonderful
sewerage system for the purpose of taking care of the sewage
of the body. This system is much more perfect than any
system ever invented by man, but it is possible for it to get
out of order. The remarkable thing about it is that the Intelligence
within the body is capable of correcting the disorders
if the interference with transmission to the affected
parts is removed. All that is necessary from the outside is
to remove that which is interfering with the transmission of
the mental impulses.</p>

<p>As long as there is interference with the transmission of
mental impulses we may apply all the laws and principles
of hygiene and sanitation, yet the internal condition will not
be hygienic or sanitary. We may, by an artificial means,
remove the waste material that has accumulated, but this will
not stop the process of accumulation.</p>

<p>In view of the fact that the above mentioned processes
of absorption and elimination are taking place, let us assume
that there is a subluxation at the kidney place (K.P.) impinging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
the nerves and interfering with the transmission of mental
impulses to the kidneys. With decreased current the kidneys
are unable to perform their normal amount of function and
as a result the waste material, poisons, or in other words
the sewage that is supposed to pass out through this channel
of excretion, are retained in the body. The poison thus
retained is spread over the entire body and there is likely to
be excessive perspiration which will have a strong odor of
urine. This is because the skin, in its excretory function, is
called upon to throw off the waste material which normally
should be excreted by the kidneys. Although there is no
perspiration there will still be a very offensive and objectionable
urinary odor from the patient’s body. From a hygienic
standpoint it is necessary for that patient to bathe very often,
but no matter how often he bathes, there is still that odor of
urine and it is impossible for him to get rid of it. One may
thoroughly and frequently cleanse that patient externally, but
there will remain that unsanitary internal condition.</p>

<p>Trying to get rid of the odor of urine and to create a
sanitary internal condition in a case of this kind by external
bathing and by the observance of sanitary laws would be
like trying to keep a boat from sinking by dipping the water
out when it was running in twice as fast as one could dip
it out. It would be better to stop the leak. If the roof of
one’s house leaks he does not try to keep the house dry by
mopping up the water and putting chlorid of lime about the
rooms to absorb the moisture. This may be done as an
adaptative measure to the condition that exists because of
the defect in the roof, but to correct the condition one must
go directly to the roof and repair it so that no more damage
may be done the interior of the house.</p>

<p>So in the case of the K.P. subluxation and the unsanitary
condition resulting from the accumulation of waste material
in the body, it is folly to try to correct the condition by any
other method than by removing the cause. The sewage must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
be carried out through the natural channels and any attempt
to dispose of it by any other or artificial means will meet with
absolute failure.</p>


<h3>Three Viewpoints on Hygiene</h3>

<p>According to Dr. B. J. Palmer there are three viewpoints
of hygiene; that is to say, there are three aspects from which
the subject of cleanliness may be considered: namely, the
medical, layman’s and chiropractic hygiene. The chief differences
are: the medical hygiene tries to make the internal
condition sanitary by the application of external means; the
layman’s hygiene makes the external condition sanitary by
the application of external means; the chiropractic hygiene
makes the internal condition sanitary by permitting the internal
forces to operate unhindered in the body.</p>

<p>We see that from every viewpoint, hygiene means cleanliness.
The only real difference in these viewpoints consists
in the methods used to obtain this desired end. The layman
maintains a sanitary external condition by observing the laws
of Nature. When dirt accumulates on the outside which
creates an unhygienic and objectionable condition, he uses
soap and water to cleanse the outside. His unhygienic condition
is outside of the body and he uses outside means to
rid himself of that condition. It is very obvious that this is
a perfectly proper procedure and if correctly and systematically
applied it will produce a hygienic external in so far as
that condition is influenced by external environment.</p>

<p>The most baffling unsanitary and unhygienic conditions
are the internal, and yet if these conditions are considered in
the light of the same common sense as is applied to the external
conditions, no great amount of difficulty will be experienced
in coping with them. However, great difficulties will
be experienced if an effort is made to keep the internal in a
proper sanitary condition by the application of external means.
This has been well demonstrated in the application of medical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
hygiene. However, the author does not want to be understood
as implying that a great deal of good has not been
accomplished in the investigations that have been made along
the line of hygiene and more especially in sanitary science.
But when chiropractic philosophy is properly understood, it
will be readily seen that it is far better to clean the inside
from the inside than to attempt cleaning the inside from the
outside. With all due regard it must be said that up to the
time of the introduction of chiropractic hygiene all the efforts
were to clean the inside from the outside, but Chiropractic
says the inside must be cleansed from the inside and this contention
has been amply proven in the results obtained through
chiropractic adjustments.</p>


<h3>Advantages of a Proper Sanitary Environment</h3>

<p>The body is capable of great possibilities in intellectual
adaptation. It is possible for Innate Intelligence to maintain
a degree of health in widely different conditions. Even where
the environment is extremely adverse and objectionable Innate
will adapt herself to the abnormal condition and maintain the
normal processes of life in the body. However, it must be
remembered that a greater amount of internal force is required
to bring about an intellectual adaptation to an adverse environment
than to a normal, natural or more perfect environment.</p>

<p>There must be a constant process of adaptation to the
environment even though that environment be a most desirable
one. All internal processes must of necessity be adaptative
to external conditions. Drummond says, “Life is uninterrupted
correspondence with proper environment.” This is
true of the expression of life. If the correspondence with
the environment is interfered with there will be a corresponding
interference with the expression of the life in the body.</p>

<p>The more adverse the environment the greater the amount
of force required to bring about this adaptation. Likewise,
the reverse is true—adaptation to a more desirable environment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
requires less internal force. We should not compel
Innate Intelligence to do things that we could do educationally
and save the body that extra amount of internal force. To
illustrate, one should not unnecessarily expose his body to
the cold and thus force Innate to expend internal energy to
adapt the body to that condition. One might better put on
proper clothing to protect the body. On the other hand, one
should not go to the other extreme and make a hothouse plant
of his body.</p>

<p>A proper sanitary environment should at all times be
maintained that there may not be an unnecessary drain on
the adaptative forces of the body.</p>


<h3>Cause of Dis-ease</h3>

<p>Chiropractic does not accept the theory that dis-ease is
caused by extrinsic conditions. There may be a great variation
in the environment and yet Innate Intelligence be able
to maintain health. If there is sufficient interference with
the transmission of mental impulses through the nerves, there
will be dis-ease in the body regardless of the perfect environment
that may be artificially produced. If the transmission is
normal the individual may take the so-called dis-ease germs
into his body and feel no ill effects for they will be excreted
as so much waste material which can not be used in the
metabolism of the body. But if there are subluxations which
interfere with the transmission of mental impulses and reduce
the process of excretion the tissues will become abnormal and
proper culture media will be formed in which there will be
developed the germs which act as scavengers for the purpose
of destroying the waste matter which accumulates. The
cause of dis-ease is within the body itself. The cause of
dis-ease is interference with transmission of mental impulses
from the brain to the periphery, thus preventing the organ
from performing its full and normal function. This results
in a lack of coördinate action between the organs of the body<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
and interferes with the intellectual adaptation to external
conditions.</p>

<p>The question may be raised at this time relative to the
effects produced by the introduction of poison into the body
and relative to germs being classed as poisons producing
certain effects in the body.</p>

<p>We will not endeavor at this time to fully deal with these
questions, for in order that the student understand thoroughly
the chiropractic idea of these things, it will be necessary to
study many points, both in connection with the hygiene and
also with the philosophy of Chiropractic.</p>

<p>This point is thoroughly covered in the philosophy under
the head of the Poison Cycle. We will simply state briefly
here that a poison is anything which can not be used in the
metabolism of the body and which, if allowed to remain in
the body, will be carried to the tissue cells and do harm. In
this event Innate will at once begin a process of elimination.
If the channels of excretion are not normal and the organs
are unable to do their work properly because of the interference
with the transmission of mental impulses, it can readily
be seen that the poison will be retained in the body and do
harm. The character of the injury will be governed by the
character of the poison retained.</p>

<p>Again, it is clearly explained in the philosophy how the
introduction of poison into the body may produce subluxations
and thus cause an interference with transmission and reduce
the adaptative action on the part of Innate to the poison
introduced. The student is referred to Volume V, Chiropractic
Library, for further explanation on this point.</p>


<h3>Sources of Communication</h3>

<p>Generally speaking, there are two main sources whereby
dis-ease is communicated: (a) man himself; (b) the animals.
Almost all of the so-called communicable dis-eases of man
are peculiar to man alone and are not found in animals except<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
as they are communicated to them for experimental purposes.
It is interesting to note that the lower animals are
much more free from contagious dis-eases than man. As a
matter of fact, the lower animals are seldom found to be
infected. It is true that the domesticated animal is more
susceptible to dis-ease than the wild animal living in the
natural state.</p>

<p>Following is a list commonly given as communicable dis-eases
peculiar to man and according to medical theory communicable
from man to man. Even among those who accept
this theory there is quite a difference of opinion as to the
dis-eases that should be included in this list. Smallpox,
chickenpox, cholera, leprosy, dengue, relapsing fever, measles,
mumps, scarlet fever, infantile paralysis, typhus fever, yellow
fever, malaria, syphilis, tuberculosis and typhoid fever. It is
maintained by hygienists that the greatest source of infection
is man himself. No longer is it thought that the environment
is the main source of infection. It is believed by Rosenau and
others that the water, soil, air and food may be the media
conveying dis-ease from man to man; these, however, are not
now considered as the main source of infection. Rosenau
says, “Most of the microörganisms causing the communicable
dis-eases of man are frail and soon die in our environment,
as in the air, soil or water. Most of them are obligate
pathogens and can not, or do not, grow and multiply under
the adverse conditions of our environment.” And yet these
frail little creatures are supposed to cause dis-ease in man.
We wish the student to bear this in mind for we will have
more to say in this respect later on.</p>

<p>It is sufficient to state here that the above named dis-eases
maintained by some to be caused by germs are corrected by
chiropractic adjustments. Chiropractic has proven that instead
of dis-ease being caused by the germ the germ is produced
by the dis-ease.</p>

<p class="center no-indent">GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS</p>
</div>

<h3>Site</h3>

<p>From a hygienic standpoint the building site bears a certain
relation to health and this should not be overlooked.
This is in perfect accord with the chiropractic philosophy as
to the expression of life in the body. The building site may
be so unnatural as to create an environment which would
draw too heavily upon the adaptative forces of the body. In
this case Innate would find difficulty in maintaining a state
of coördination.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="image028" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image028.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">Model Site</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The artificial methods of living must be made to conform
as nearly as possible to the needs of the body. Damp surroundings
might have no ill effects upon the individual who
was living a very active life outdoors “roughing it,” but place
that individual in a damp, poorly lighted and poorly heated
house where he is less active and his expression of life will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
be materially affected. Innate requires a proper environment,
although not necessarily a perfect one, but it must be such
that an adaptation can be maintained.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="image029" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image029.jpg" alt="Unsanitary building site.">
</figure>

<p>If the building site is damp it will require special methods
to prevent the dampness from entering the house. This is
expensive and if the site is too humid such a method will
prove highly unsatisfactory. If the location is cold the house
is very likely to be cold. The site should be well adapted
to the needs of the building.</p>


<h3>Aspect</h3>

<p>The importance of the aspect should not be overlooked.
A southeasterly facing is generally considered best, because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
it is dry and mild and has the morning sun and yet is not
exposed to the hot afternoon sun.</p>

<p>The main living rooms should be so arranged as to admit
the direct rays of the sun some time during the day. This
can best be accomplished when these rooms are on the southeast.
Each room should be so arranged with respect to
window space that there will be ample lighting and proper
ventilation of the whole house. Care must be exercised, however,
that there is not too much window space which will give
excessive heat in summer or too much cold in winter.</p>

<p>In large dwellings there is a tendency for the halls and
stairways to be poorly lighted and poorly ventilated. This
should not be. Ample provision supplying light through
windows, and ventilation from the outside should be made to
insure plenty of light and air.</p>

<p>Bedrooms should be well lighted and if possible direct
sunshine should be admitted some time during the day, preferably
in the morning.</p>


<h3>Soil</h3>

<p>The soil bears a close relation to health. The porous soils
such as sand and gravel are considered the most healthful
because they are driest. But there are objections to these,
since they are easily polluted by leaky drains and cesspools,
and are capable of holding a notable volume of ground water
and ground air. Such air is almost invariably impure. The
rain percolates through the soil until it reaches an impervious
stratum which prevents it from penetrating any further, and
it is held in the interstices or interspaces of the soil and forms
the ground water.</p>


<h3>Ground Water and Ground Air</h3>

<p>There is a certain fluctuation of ground water and ground
air. As the water rises the air is forced out of the ground,
and as it recedes air is drawn in to occupy its place. There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
are other factors which influence the ground air, such as the
perflating action of the wind and certain climatic changes.
Thus the ground may be spoken of as breathing.</p>

<p>If the ground water is near the surface the ground air
will be noticeably moist and will produce a dampness of the
atmosphere which will result in a decided cooling of the air
by evaporation. If the ground water is deep the ground air
will be comparatively dry, although the ground near the surface
is generally moist owing to the capillary attraction and
evaporation from the surface of the ground water. For this
reason it is important that damp soils be properly drained to
permanently lower the level of the ground water. This may
be accomplished by properly laid tile. This will reduce the
fluctuation of the ground water since it will be carried off
when it rises to the level of the drains. In this way the
ground air will not be forced out into the breathing zone to
pollute the atmosphere.</p>

<p>The ground air is impure due to the organic matter in the
soil. This organic matter is decomposed by microörganisms
that feed upon such material and break it up into simpler
combinations, carbonic acid, ammonia and water. These
processes of fermentation and decay result in a purifying
action converting the complex organic matter into products
which growing vegetation is capable of assimilating. The
presence of oxygen, moisture and warmth is essential to the
proper execution of these processes. We can thus see that
ample provision has been made for the natural purification
and utilization of animal and vegetable matter. Nature provides
the oxygen in the ground air, the necessary moisture
is derived from the ground water and the temperature of
the earth is generally sufficient to supply the needed warmth
for this natural process of purification.</p>

<p>If the ground water rises too near the surface or if the
building site is water-logged, the water may be drawn off
by means of a subsoil drainage. This will also prevent fluctuation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
of ground water, for as this water rises the ground air
is forced out and causes the atmospheric air to become damp.
This brings about a cooling of the air. The moisture will
ascend by capillary attraction into the walls of the houses; in
the evaporation from the inner surfaces, heat will be absorbed
from the surrounding objects and this will cause the houses
to become damp and cold.</p>

<p>This drainage may be accomplished by placing unglazed
porous tiles with the ends in apposition, but not jointed in the
subsoil. The fluctuation of ground water is of little consequence
in itself; but we can see that in this way the water
in wells may become polluted, impure ground air may be
forced into houses, and dampness may thus be produced.</p>


<h3>Stagnant Water</h3>

<p>Stagnant water favors the breeding of mosquitoes and the
development of certain dis-eases, malaria and cholera for
example; hence the necessity for proper drainage. Trees are
sometimes planted in such districts and they, together with
the subsoil drainage, render the conditions more healthful.
The trees and other vegetation in hot climates absorb the
water from the ground and then it is evaporated from the
leaves and in this way soil is made drier.</p>


<h2>BUILDING CONSTRUCTION</h2>


<h3>Foundation</h3>

<p>In the building of a house the foundation must receive
just consideration. As the foundation holds the entire structure,
such material must be used as to give adequate support
to this weight. Care must be exercised in the evacuations that
the basement be protected from dampness and that the entire
site beneath the foundation be properly drained. The ground
water should be ten feet beneath the surface of the site.</p>

<p>It is recommended by some hygienists that the basement
floor be of cement six inches thick to prevent the entrance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
of ground air and moisture. This should be covered with a
wood floor.</p>

<p>The preparation of the foundation is comparatively easy
where the ground is solid, but if the site be water-logged,
marshy, quicksand, or entirely under water, its preparation
then becomes a problem that may baffle the best engineers.
Artificial foundation beds may have to be resorted to. These
are accomplished in several ways. One very common method
is to drive wooden piles into the ground, saw off the tops and
construct the foundation on these piles. Another method is
that of the cofferdam.</p>

<p>The foundation having been properly prepared, care must
be taken that the footings or base course of the walls are of
sufficient strength to bear the weight of the superstructure.
The footings should be of stone or concrete and should be
a little thicker than the walls.</p>

<p>Precautions for a dry basement must also be considered.
This subject will be discussed under House Dampness.</p>

<p>The air of the basement must be kept pure by proper
ventilation, since it is being constantly drawn up into the
house. This will receive some attention in the chapter on
Ventilation.</p>


<h3>Walls</h3>

<p>The walls of the house may be of brick, stone, timber or
concrete. The method of construction will depend upon the
material used. If timber is utilized the security of the walls
will be governed by the timber posts, sills and plates. The
materials used should be as little absorbent of moisture as
possible. All wood should be well seasoned.</p>


<h3>Floors</h3>

<p>In order to meet all sanitary requirements the “floors
must be secure and proof against air, dust, sound, vermin, fire
and water.” But it is not often that the floors meet all these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
sanitary demands. Ordinary floors are made of hard boards
tongued and grooved, tightly fitted and laid upon joists placed
about one foot apart; the under surface is lathed and plastered
to form the ceiling of the room below, or some sort of patent
ceiling may be used. However, there is great objection to the
space thus left between the floor and the ceiling, as it becomes
a receptacle for dust and greatly endangers the spread of fire.</p>

<p>It is better, according to sanitary demands, to have the
floor of reinforced concrete, or the space within filled with
mineral wool or asbestos; or the floor may be made of steel
beams encased in terra-cotta with interspaces made of concrete.</p>


<h3>Roof</h3>

<p>For roofing some non-absorbent material is best. Wood
shingles are possibly the most common in this country,
although they are rapidly being replaced with composition
shingles. The wood shingles are somewhat absorbent and
are inflammable. Slate and tile are also used. The slate is
a good conductor of heat, and is hot in summer and cold in
winter. Tiles are heavy but are warm in winter and cool in
summer. Lead, zinc and copper have all been used, but they
are good conductors of heat and for various other reasons are
not exactly desirable. The best method of preventing too
rapid conduction of heat is to have an air space between the
roof and the ceiling of the top floor.</p>


<h3>House Dampness</h3>

<p>Great care should be exercised to prevent the entrance of
moisture into the house. A damp house is very objectionable.
In a newly constructed building there is always more or less
dampness coming from green lumber, mortar and plaster.
This is known as building water. Before a new house is
occupied it should be thoroughly dried by a fire in stoves or
furnaces. Dampness from building water is only temporary
and easily eliminated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>

<p>Moisture in houses from damp sites, leaky drains, porous
building material which admits rain and other similar causes,
require the attention of an engineer who understands water-proof
construction.</p>

<p>Moisture from the ground water may ascend the walls
of the building by capillary attraction. This may be prevented
by properly draining the site and by placing a horizontal
water-proof course in the walls. This may consist of
asphalt one-half inch thick or a course of slate or other material
through which the moisture will not penetrate.</p>

<p>The ill effects of a damp house upon the health of the
occupants can hardly be overestimated. Such houses are cold,
being difficult to heat and ventilate. The bodily heat is too
rapidly withdrawn. This necessitates adaptative action on
the part of Innate Intelligence and requires an unnecessary
expenditure of internal energy.</p>

<p>Aside from a damp house having an ill effect upon health
by creating an environment which is not conducive to the
expression of life indoors, the dampness tends to produce
moulds and otherwise injure the furniture and hangings. This
results in a musty odor and creates a condition conducive to
the development of cockroaches and water bugs. These conditions
are repulsive to the finer sensibilities.</p>

<p>It is a recognized fact that Innate Intelligence is able to
adapt the body to various conditions and people who appear
to be in a state of comparatively good health may be found
in such environments, but why should we force Innate to
adapt the body to such adverse conditions when we may educationally
improve the surroundings and make them more
healthful? The educated mind is the expression of the same
Innate Intelligence that is adapting the body to the environment,
so it is only reasonable that the educated mind should
be used in as intelligent a manner as the Innate mind. It is
the function of the educated mind to bring about an educated
adaptation to the environment through the educated body and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
to study the laws of nature and adapt them to the needs
of the body.</p>

<p>So it is in perfect accord with chiropractic philosophy
that a proper dwelling be provided wherein the condition is
such that there may be perfect adaptation to all the needs of
the body. This is as much a part of the chiropractor’s work
as is any other part of his duties and obligations to the sick.
He need not be able to do all these things, but he should
know what conditions are conducive to the expression of life
in the body and why others are not.</p>


<h3>Fireproofing</h3>

<p>The expression, fireproof, is a misnomer. There are no
materials that are absolutely fireproof, but there are many
that, are fire resisting. A material may be ignition-proof but
not capable of resisting high temperatures. Some metals will
withstand higher temperatures than others.</p>

<p>Fire protection is important from the standpoint of
hygiene, since it is a factor in preventing loss of life and
property. It will also be observed that fire-resisting material
and fireproof construction is more sanitary than soft absorbent
materials and improper house construction.</p>

<p>Three methods are used in reducing the danger from fire:
First, by the use of fire-resisting building material; second,
by proper fireproof construction; third, by providing ample
fire escapes and fire extinguishers.</p>

<p>In a fireproof building all inflammable materials are eliminated
and such materials as brick, reinforced concrete, stone
and burnt terra cotta are used. As has been stated before,
these materials are not fireproof but only fire-resisting. They
will all be affected by fire if the intensity is great enough.</p>

<p>In the construction of fireproof buildings, only fire-resisting
materials are used. No wood nor other combustible materials
are utilized. All spaces, air wells and air shafts are eliminated
as far as possible. The floors are constructed of rolled wrought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
iron on steel floor beams, or of Portland cement. The roofs
are made of burnt terra cotta, rolled wrought iron or cement.</p>

<p>The stairways and landings are of brick, stone, cement,
iron or steel, all wood being eliminated even for windows and
doors. The partitions are constructed of fireproof material
such as hollow tile.</p>

<p>Every building should be provided with ample fire escapes
to furnish plenty of exits in case of fire. This is accomplished
by providing wide stairways and by furnishing sufficient fire
escapes on the outside of the building. These fire escapes
should be constructed of metal or some fire-resisting material.</p>


<h3>House Plumbing</h3>

<p>A system of house plumbing consists of pipes carrying the
water into the house, the fixtures or receptacles which are
used to receive the waste and refuse from the household and
the processes that are performed in the house. The latter
includes the fixtures of the bathroom—the stool, bath tub, lavatory
and foot tub; those of the kitchen such as the sink;
those of the laundry; and the system of pipes which carry
the refuse from the house into the main sewer.</p>

<p>Between the pipes which carry the water into the house
and those which carry the sewage out are placed the house
fixtures. There is a pipe leading to each fixture which carries
the water to dilute the sewage, and a pipe leading from each
of these fixtures carrying the sewage to the main house drain.
The admission of sewer gas into the house through the fixtures
is prevented by the trap which contains water known
as the seal. The trap is of no value unless it is properly
sealed. The trap is simply a bend in the pipe, as shown in
the illustration, in which water is contained. This water
keeps the sewer air from coming back into the house.</p>

<p>A system of house plumbing, in order to meet the requirements
of hygiene, must be properly trapped. There is a small<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
trap for each fixture and in some cities an additional outside
trap is required which protects the entire system.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp45" id="image038" style="max-width: 43.875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image038.jpg" alt="bowl and trap">
</figure>

<p>When some fixture loses its seal then there is great danger
of sewer air coming into the house. The main causes for traps
becoming unsealed are: the forcible ejection of the seal by
the momentum of the flush; loss of seal through siphon; the
evaporation of the water when the fixture is not in use; and
by capillary attraction as when waste paper or some similar
material is left in the trap and projects through. Siphonage
is caused by a large volume of water passing down through
a vertical pipe with which the fixture is connected.</p>

<p>The loss of the seal by evaporation may be prevented by
frequent use of the fixture, or if the fixture is not to be used<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
for some time the trap may be filled with oil or some substance
that will not evaporate. The loss of the seal from momentum
may be averted by providing proper flushing tanks, while the
protection from capillary attraction may be effected by not
allowing anything to remain in the trap which will exert this
capillary attraction on the water in the trap.</p>

<p>Prevention of siphonage is accomplished by providing
proper ventilation for each trap so there may be a column
of air which may be drawn upon in lieu of the seal.</p>

<p>Care should be taken that the seal does not become foul.
The fouling of the seal is the result of back pressure from
the sewer and may be avoided by providing a vent pipe
through which the air may pass from the sewer and thus
relieve the pressure on the seal.</p>

<p>The sewage is carried from the house by the house sewer
into the street sewer, from the street sewer into the district
sewers, and then into the large trunk sewers. There are also
relief sewers, storm sewers, under drains, and intercepting
sewers. The entire system is known as the sewerage system.</p>

<p>The amount of water required to carry away the sewage
varies in different cities. In the smaller towns it may be as
low as fifty gallons a day per capita, while in some of the
larger cities it may be as much as 200 gallons per capita
per day.</p>

<p>At one time the sewer gas was considered the greatest
menace to workmen in the sewers. But it has been found
that there is little danger from this gas. Sewer air is very
objectionable because of the very foul odor, but even those
who contend that germs cause dis-ease maintain that there is
little danger of contracting dis-ease from breathing sewer air.</p>

<p class="center no-indent bold fs120">AIR</p>


<p class="center no-indent">CONSTITUENTS OF AIR</p>

<p>Air is a mixture of gases, not a chemical compound, which
envelops the earth and it is estimated to be at least one
hundred miles high. This gaseous envelope is known as the
atmosphere. The water upon the earth’s surface is called the
aquasphere. The solid substance composing the earth is
known as the petrosphere.</p>

<p>Air performs a very important function in the interchanging
of gases in respiration and in the regulation of bodily
temperature. The gases contained in the atmosphere are
given by most authorities in the following proportions, per
volume:</p>

<table class="autotable fs80" style="width: 50%">
<tr>
<td class="tdl">Oxygen</td>
<td class="tdr">20.93%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdl">Nitrogen</td>
<td class="tdr">78.10%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdl">Argon</td>
<td class="tdr">0.94%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdl">Carbon Dioxide</td>
<td class="tdr">0.03%</td>
</tr>
</table>

<div class="blockquot fs80">
<p>With traces of helium, krypton, neon, xenon,
hydrogen, ammonia, ozone and hydrogen peroxide.</p>
</div>

<p>It is also found that there is a varying amount of water
in the air, as well as dust and other substances. It is worthy
of note that the air maintains a wonderful uniformity of composition
over the entire surface of the earth. This is undoubtedly
due to the fact that the atmosphere is in constant
motion which maintains its proper mixture. It must also be
noted that the air is not a chemical compound but is a mixture
of gases.</p>


<h3>Oxygen (O)</h3>

<p>Probably the most important element in air is the oxygen
which represents about one-fifth of its composition. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
percentage is maintained with very slight variation; for instance,
the percentage of oxygen in towns will be slightly less
than 20.93%, about 20.87%.</p>

<p>When the atmosphere contains only 11% or 12% of oxygen
it becomes dangerous, and death results when the percentage
gets as low as 7.2%. A candle will not burn with the oxygen
at 16%. Slight variation in the amount of oxygen is of no
special importance.</p>

<p>The amount of oxygen in the air has little to do with
the amount absorbed in respiration, as this is governed more
by the need of the body than by the amount taken into the
lungs.</p>

<p>Nature has made a wonderful provision in the protection
of the body from extreme changes in the amount of oxygen
in the air. This provision increases the degree of intellectual
adaptation which is possible in the body. This is shown by
the fact that there is a larger amount of oxygen contained
at all times in the lungs than is required to supply the red
blood cells. It is maintained that the alveolar air contains
normally 16% of oxygen. The red blood cells are practically
saturated with oxygen as they leave the lungs; however, this
amount of oxygen may not be needed by the tissue cells which
the red blood cells supply and the amount they absorb upon
their return will depend upon what they have given off to
the tissue cells.</p>

<p>It can readily be seen that the air in the lungs at no time
contains the full percentage of oxygen, since one at no time
completely exhales the entire amount of air. In this way
the residual air loses some of its oxygen and collects carbon
dioxide.</p>

<p>Animal life is sustained by the oxygen in the air while
the carbon dioxide is essential to plant life. The oxygen is
carried into the lungs during the inhalation which is produced
by the expression of Innate Intelligence through the
organs of respiration. The oxygen passes into the blood and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
is combined loosely with the hemoglobin of the red blood
corpuscles; then under the direction of Innate it is carried
to all the tissue cells of the body. Here the oxygen leaves
the blood and is used in the oxidation which is necessary in
the metabolism of the body.</p>

<p>The amount of required oxygen varies with different conditions
that obtain in the body and is dependent upon age,
the activity of the individual and his condition of health.
Some authors assert that the average person will inhale about
thirty-four pounds of air in twenty-four hours. This would
mean a little over seven pounds of oxygen. Only about one-fourth
of the oxygen inhaled is absorbed; therefore, according
to these figures the individual would absorb on an average
of about two pounds of oxygen in twenty-four hours.</p>


<h3>Nitrogen (N)</h3>

<p>The nitrogen in the air is of more importance to plant life
than to animal life. It is of little significance from a hygienic
standpoint, yet it is an important constituent of all matter
containing protein. Nitrogen tends to regulate or influence
the rate of combustion by diluting the oxygen in the air.
Respiration does not seem to affect the amount of nitrogen
in the air as there is no noticeable difference between the
amount of nitrogen in the inspired and expired air.</p>


<h3>Argon (A)</h3>

<p>In 1894 Lord Rayleigh and Prof. William Ramsay discovered
a gaseous substance in the atmosphere which had
no chemical affinity. They gave this element the name argon
which means in the Greek, “inactive.” So far as is known
argon will not combine with any other element.</p>

<p>The atmosphere contains about 0.94% argon, but so far,
according to Rosenau, it has not been demonstrated in the
body. Argon has no hygienic significance. Helium, krypton,
xenon, neon and argon form what is known as the <b>argon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
group</b>, since they will not unite with other elements to form
compounds. These elements are all found in very small
quantities in the atmosphere.</p>


<h3>Carbon Dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)</h3>

<p>Carbon dioxide is a gas, a very small amount of which is
found in the atmosphere. About 0.03% is ordinarily expressed.
This means there are three parts of carbon dioxide in 10,000
parts of atmosphere. This is a very small percentage, but
when we consider the enormous bulk of atmosphere we appreciate
the fact that the total amount is beyond our comprehension.
It is claimed that there is more carbon in the
atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide than there is in
all other forms on the earth.</p>

<p>In densely populated areas there is a slight increase in
the amount of carbon dioxide. It may reach 0.04% or even
0.05%. There is also likely to be more carbon dioxide in the
air close to the soil than there is a few feet above. This is
because the processes going on in the soil tend to produce
this gas and hence the soil air contains a larger percentage.
The air receives its carbon dioxide from such sources as respiration,
fermentation, from chemical action in the soil, from
mineral springs, and from oxidation of organic matter.</p>

<p>Carbon dioxide is a transparent, odorless and colorless gas.
It is a very important constituent in the atmosphere and a
very slight variation either in its increase or decrease will
vitally interfere with both animal and vegetable life. Green
plants in the sunlight absorb great quantities of carbon dioxide
and give off oxygen. The body obtains its carbon from the
food that is taken in while the oxygen is obtained from the
air that is breathed. It is maintained that one acre of ordinary
tree land will withdraw as much as four and one-half
tons of carbon dioxide from the air in one season. Carbon
dioxide is also absorbed by water; hence the oceans and other
large bodies of water perform a very important function in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
this respect. In certain localities, such as industrial centers,
a very large amount of carbon dioxide is given off into the
air; but this is quickly taken up and thoroughly mixed with
the atmosphere by the constant motion which is maintained
by the varying temperature, air pressure and other involved
factors. It is not allowed to accumulate in any one place in
larger amounts than normal. In this way the proportion is
kept the same at all times.</p>

<p>Hygienists maintain that the regulation of breathing is
largely dependent on the concentration of carbon dioxide in
the air cells of the lungs. This, however, is not true since
the process of respiration is not a question of chemical action
nor the influence of any chemical element in the lungs or in
any part of the respiratory system. The breathing, like all
other functions of the body, is under the direct control of
Innate Intelligence within the body.</p>

<p>Innate Intelligence, recognizing the need for more oxygen
in the tissue cells, will bring about an intellectual adaptation
by increasing the respiration. This does not take place, however,
until the need has exceeded the already adaptative possibility
when the reserve amount of oxygen contained in the
residual air in the lungs has been exhausted.</p>

<p>In inspiration the air is taken into the lungs and the oxygen
is taken up by the hemoglobin of the blood as before stated;
then the oxygen is given off to the tissue cells. The hemoglobin
absorbs the carbon dioxide from the tissues and it is
then carried back to the lungs where the process is reversed.
That is, the carbon dioxide is given off and the oxygen is
absorbed by the hemoglobin.</p>

<p>The carbon dioxide which is carried to the lungs by the
venous blood escapes into the air cells. The resistance which
it meets here depends upon the percentage of carbon dioxide
present in the alveolar air. Normally the percentage of the
carbon dioxide in the alveolar air is maintained at a pressure
of about 5% of an atmosphere. If the pressure becomes less<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
than this Innate Intelligence will adapt herself to this condition
by decreasing the respiration until the normal percentage
is again attained; or if the pressure goes above
normal Innate will increase the rate of respiration until the
amount of carbon dioxide has been decreased in the alveolar
air, for this poisonous gas must be eliminated. This shows
how Innate at all times is working in an adaptative way to
maintain equilibrium in the body.</p>


<h3>Ozone (O<sub>3</sub>)</h3>

<p>Ozone is not a constant element in air, although of such
potency that a very small amount may be of great importance.
In centers of population it is usually absent. In thickly
wooded sections and at sea it will be found in large quantities,
but even here only traces will be found. It is thought to be
formed by the friction of the sea water against the air in
connection with the respiration of vegetation. It is also formed
in nature by electric discharges during storms.</p>


<h3>Ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>)</h3>

<p>Normally there is only a trace of ammonia in air. It is
produced by the decomposition of organic matter. This
accounts for the larger amount being found in the air near
the ground. Ground air may contain ammonia in sufficient
quantity to be perceptible to the senses.</p>


<h3>Other Constituents</h3>

<p>Hydrogen peroxide is a very active oxidizing agent. Rain
water and snow contain very small traces of it. Hydrogen
peroxide is not constant in air, but may be found in very
small quantities.</p>

<p>Air also contains small traces of helium, krypton, neon,
xenon, which have no important bearing from a hygienic
standpoint. Nitric, sulphuric and other acids will at times
be found in the atmosphere. These acids are formed principally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
from industrial processes and will, therefore, be found
near industrial centers, rather than in the open country or
at sea.</p>


<h2>AIR PRESSURE</h2>


<h3>Normal Air Pressure</h3>

<p>Ordinary air pressure on the surface of the earth at sea
level is, in round numbers, fifteen pounds to the square inch.
It has been found that the average sized man is exposed to
about 34,000 pounds of pressure. This pressure may be increased
or decreased, and if the change takes place gradually
so that Innate Intelligence will have time to adapt the body
to the change, no harm will result. There is a limit, however,
either in a decrease or in an increase of pressure to
which the body may be adapted.</p>

<p>This intellectual adaptation obtains in every tissue cell of
the body as well as in all of its secretions and chemicals so
it can be seen that any sudden change in the atmospheric
pressure will disturb the equilibrium of the entire body.</p>


<h3>Reduced Air Pressure</h3>

<p>When the atmospheric pressure is decreased it has the
same effect on the individual that the breathing of rarefied or
diluted air has. In this event the adaptation consists in an
increased rate of breathing. It is also asserted that the number
of red blood corpuscles is increased, which in turn increases
the capacity of the blood to carry oxygen. In the diminished
air pressure there is a marked decrease in the amount of
oxygen absorption and this accounts for the increase in the
respiration and quickened pulse rate.</p>

<p>As previously stated, if the change from a normal air
pressure to a greatly decreased pressure takes place gradually,
thus giving Innate sufficient time to bring about an adaptation,
man will be enabled to live in a healthy state in a
rarefied air. As the altitude is increased the air pressure is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
decreased. This is because there is less air above to exert
pressure. Naturally the air near the earth has the greatest
weight above it to exert compression. The air pressure decreases
gradually until, it is assumed, it is gradually thinned
into a perfect vacuum. If oxygen is added to the air it is
possible to maintain life at a remarkably reduced air pressure.
A bird was kept alive by P. Bert in oxygenated air at a
pressure of 0.1 of an atmosphere.</p>

<p>The <b>symptoms</b> produced in diminished air pressure will
vary with the general conditions of the individual. People
suffering from cardiac disturbances will be affected most by
high altitudes. This is possibly the first symptom to be
manifested in rarefied air. If there is any inclination toward
heart weakness it will be observed when the air pressure is
decreased.</p>

<p>The effects of reduced air pressure will vary with circumstances.
There will be increased and deep breathing, with
an increase in the pulse rate. There is likely to be dizziness
and ringing in the ears. The sense of hearing, of sight and
possibly of sensations, become impaired. There may be
drowsiness and the patient may have a strong desire to sleep.
The intellectual faculties become dull. Where the change has
taken place very suddenly to the decreased air pressure there
will be syncope, dyspnea, dizziness, nausea and weakness.
These symptoms are commonly known as mountain sickness.</p>


<h3>Increased Air Pressure</h3>

<p>The greatest air pressure in nature is at sea level. Even
the increased pressure in the deepest mines is so slight that
it has no physiological significance; hence man is exposed
to increased air pressure only under artificial conditions. This
subject will be referred to again under the head of Industrial
Hygiene.</p>

<p>Some of the conditions under which man is exposed to
increased air pressure are, for example, divers in diving bells<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
and diving suits, and caisson workers. At a depth of ten
meters of water the air in a diving bell is compressed to one-half
its original bulk, and as a result the pressure of air is
doubled. At thirty meters, or about 100 feet, the pressure is
quadrupled, exposing the diver to four atmospheres or about
sixty pounds per square inch.</p>

<p>The danger in increased air pressure is not in going from
a normal pressure to a high pressure, nor does the danger
come from the high pressure. The danger is not from the
compression, but rather from the decompression. The individual
must be brought from the increased air pressure to
the normal air pressure very gradually, allowing Innate sufficient
time to adapt the body to the normal pressure of fifteen
pounds to the square inch. If this is done no great amount
of harm will result, although there are some men who are
not able to withstand these changes. This shows a lack of
intellectual adaptation through the body on the part of its
Innate. In an experiment P. Bert exposed dogs to an air
pressure of ten atmospheres, or about 150 pounds to the square
inch, and then released them very gradually, producing no
ill effects.</p>

<p>When the air pressure is increased it results in an increase
in the absorption of the gases of the atmosphere. There is
an increased amount of oxygen taken up by the blood and
the tissues absorb large amounts of nitrogen. When the
pressure is released slowly these gases gradually escape from
the lungs and no bubbles will be formed.</p>

<p>During compression the symptoms are not so severe as
those during and after decompression. During compression
the symptoms are a deepening but slowing of the respiration,
a slowing of the pulse rate, and an interference in evaporation
in the water vapor. The increased pressure on the ear
drums will cause pain in the ears and sometimes the ear drums
rupture. There may be an alteration in the voice, headache
and dizziness. However, in a short time, intellectual adaptation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
takes place and equilibrium is established by the internal
change and there is at least temporary relief from these
symptoms.</p>


<h3>Caisson Dis-ease</h3>

<p>The greatest risk to health and life occurs during the time
the individual is coming from the high to normal pressure
after the decompression has entirely taken place. This may
produce a condition known as caisson dis-ease. It may be several
hours after the workman has been taken from the decompressing
chambers before the symptoms appear. Gradual
decompression is the only thing that will prevent the manifestation
of these symptoms. When the workman shows any
symptoms of caisson dis-ease he should be rushed back into
the compression chambers and kept there a short time until
Innate has a chance to establish equilibrium in the pressure
of the body, and he should then be taken very gradually
through the decompression chambers.</p>

<p>The <b>symptoms</b> that appear after decompression are vertigo,
nose bleeding, nausea and vomiting. The most common symptom
is the severe pains in the muscles and joints which is
known by the layman as bends. There may also be temporary
or permanent paralysis called diver’s palsy. In the more
severe cases there will be unconsciousness, and even death.</p>

<p>When the workman is taken too quickly from the high
pressure there is formed gas and air emboli. These may form
in the labyrinth of the ear, in the spinal cord, in the brain,
in the heart, or in any other vital part of the body and not
only be distressing but may even prove fatal.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that the conditions produced by
changes in the air pressure may be classed as traumatic, immunity
from which is not entirely a question of uninterrupted
transmission. If there are subluxations in the spine at the
time the workman goes into the caisson, or if subluxations
are produced at the time of decompression, the interference<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
thus produced will interrupt the process of intellectual adaptation.
Such subluxations should be adjusted, but it must be
remembered that if emboli are formed or if bends occur the
result or the relief is a question of the natural processes of
Innate in the body, and the results will depend entirely upon
the ability of Innate to cope with the traumatic condition.
Innate Intelligence operates through the body according to
law, and it is possible for the body to become so affected and
deteriorated that it becomes a physical impossibility for her
then to repair it and restore it to normal.</p>

<p>We have seen that the normal air pressure at sea level is
fifteen pounds to the square inch. In order that the body
will not be crushed by this weight it is necessary to have
an internal resistance to equal this weight. This internal
resistance is maintained in the body by the tone of all of its
parts; it is maintained by the expression of mental impulses
in the tissue cells.</p>

<p>We have also observed that the combining of chemicals
is influenced by the pressure exerted; therefore, in order that
the chemical combinations of the body be constant there must
be equilibrium established between the external pressure and
the internal resistance. This is maintained through the adaptability
of the expression of Innate in the body. As the change
takes place externally there is a corresponding adaptative
change taking place internally and this all requires time.
Therefore, in passing the body from one air pressure to that
of another degree, there must be a sufficient amount of time
intervening to allow Innate Intelligence to bring about the
necessary adaptation.</p>

<p>The changes that take place under differing degrees of
air pressure are not purely the result of chemical changes in
the body as is maintained by some, but in all these processes
we see the evidence of intelligent action which we believe
is the result of the reasoning of the intelligence in the body.
One evidence of this is that when the workman is brought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
gradually from an increased air pressure to the normal air
pressure the gases that have been absorbed by the tissues
under the abnormal condition will be given off through the
normal channels, and less injury will be done. It is interesting
to note that in Nature, man is not exposed to a greater air
pressure than that at sea level; it is only under artificial, man-invented
environments that the body is called upon to withstand
a greater pressure than the normal. It may also be noted
that without the inventions of man it requires quite a little
time for man to be transported from the air pressure at sea
level to that of the higher altitudes as on the mountain tops.
This gives Innate Intelligence an opportunity to bring about
an adaptation to this change, since the change in the pressure
takes place so gradually. But with man-made inventions,
such as the automobile and aeroplane, one may transfer himself
from sea level to great heights where the pressure is less
in a very short time. This does not allow sufficient time for
adaptation to take place and is much different from the slow
process of climbing the mountains.</p>

<p>So we see that, after all, most of the necessity for immediate
adaptation of the body to changed environmental conditions
is the result of the work of the educated mind of man,
and not the result of the laws of Nature. In Nature we seldom
see the necessity for sudden or extreme adaptation. But under
our present artificial means of living there are such cases,
and these necessitate a study of the artificial conditions as
well as a study of the Innate laws of adaptation that there
may be as far as possible an educated adaptation to the
environment.</p>


<h2>HUMIDITY AND TEMPERATURE OF AIR</h2>


<h3>Humidity</h3>

<p>Water vapor is present at all times in the atmosphere.
It is the least constant of all of the air constituents, varying
greatly under different conditions. The temperature produces<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
a greater change in the amount of aqueous vapor in the air
than any other factor. There may be so much water vapor in
the air that the air is spoken of as being completely saturated.
This is known as absolute humidity. If there is any excess
over and above this complete saturation, it is given off as dew;
it is spoken of then as having reached the dew point. It must
be remembered that this absolute humidity does not represent
a constant amount of water vapor, for the amount of moisture
necessary to produce complete saturation varies with the
degree of temperature. It is erroneous to speak of the air
holding water.</p>

<p>“As a matter of fact, the air has nothing to do with it, for
it has always been clearly observed that the presence of water
vapor in any given space is independent of the presence or
absence of air in the same space. The amount of aqueous
vapor which a space contains depends entirely upon the temperature
and not upon the presence of the air.”—Rosenau in
<cite>Preventive Medicine and Hygiene</cite>.</p>

<p>The higher the temperature the greater the amount of
water vapor in one cubic foot of air at a temperature of
10° F., while at 100° F. there would be 19.1 grains at complete
saturation. Since increased temperature increases the
amount of aqueous vapor and this aqueous vapor in turn
absorbs heat, we thus see a reciprocal action of the aqueous
vapor upon the temperature.</p>

<p><b>Absolute humidity</b> is all of the water vapor that may be
contained in the air at a given temperature. <b>Relative humidity</b>
is the difference between the amount of water vapor that must
be contained in the air at a given temperature to reach absolute
saturation and the amount actually contained in the air
at that same temperature.</p>

<p>If the relative humidity of the air in a room becomes as
high as 85% the moisture will begin to condense and form
on the walls and objects. This makes the room damp and
interferes with the ventilating and heating of the room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span></p>

<p>There is less water vapor contained in the air at high
altitudes, the air being cooler. A large amount of rainfall
does not necessarily produce an increase in the relative
humidity. That is to say, a country with a very high average
of rainfall is not necessarily a damp country so far as the
atmosphere is concerned.</p>


<h3>Cold Dry Air</h3>

<p>Cold dry air is exhilarating and tends to quicken metabolism
in the body, while warm damp air is depressing and
tends to retard metabolism.</p>

<p>The body possesses great possibilities of adaptation to the
varying degrees of temperature and humidity through the
action of Innate Intelligence. With the aid of the educated
mind in bringing about adaptation in the way of clothing, for
example, it is possible to increase the range of temperature
and humidity to which the body may be adapted.</p>

<p>Due to the fact that heat is being constantly formed in
the body by the different processes that are carried on within,
it naturally follows that this heat must be carried out of
the body or it will accumulate and result in harm to the
tissues, producing what is known as heat stroke. This heat
dissipation is greatly influenced by the humidity, or in
other words, the amount of water vapor in the air. The
temperature of the air also has some influence on heat dissipation.</p>

<p>Cold air is made to feel colder by an increase in the amount
of moisture while warm or hot air is made hotter by increasing
the moisture. The reason for this is that the moisture
in the cold air favors heat conduction, hence draws the heat
from the body at a more rapid rate than is normal, while the
moisture in the hot air hinders evaporation.</p>

<p>Innate Intelligence is able, through the specially devised
machinery of the body, to maintain a perfect balance between
heat production and heat dissipation or heat loss. Even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
though the temperature of the air may rise, yet if the body is
normal it will not produce an increase in the bodily temperature.
Indeed, it is asserted that when the temperature of
the air goes above 70° F. the bodily temperature would rise
if it were not for the perspiration which Innate will produce
through the sweat glands. As long as the perspiration is
produced and is evaporated from the surface of the body the
heat production and heat loss will be kept in perfect balance.
But when something interferes with this adaptative process
of Innate and the individual can not perspire, there will soon
be symptoms of overheating and the temperature of the body
will begin to rise.</p>

<p>Evaporation is decreased in an atmosphere in which the
humidity is high. The reason for this is obvious; the atmosphere
already filled with water vapor is slow to take up more.
This is because molecules of vapor given off from the body
collide with those in the air and are returned to the surface
of the body as moisture. When this condition obtains there
is an adaptation produced by increasing the amount of blood
to the skin; this increases the temperature of the surface of
the body, but allows for an increase in the heat loss by
radiation, conduction and convection.</p>

<p>The conductivity of the atmosphere for heat is increased
by an increase in the humidity; hence a cool damp air will
chill the body for the reason that the conductivity is increased
and bodily heat is lost more rapidly through conduction. Increased
humidity interferes with the evaporation of perspiration;
hence a hot, moist air is heating to the body and deprives
the body of force, making the patient feel sluggish and
fatigued.</p>

<p>There is much moisture given off from the body each day.
It is estimated by Pettenkofer, Voit, Rosenau and others that
the average individual under ordinary circumstances will give
off through the lungs about 290 grams, and from the skin
from 500 to 1800 grams daily. If this fact is kept in mind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
some idea of the necessity of proper ventilation will be
appreciated.</p>


<h3>Warm Moist Air</h3>

<p>Workers fatigue much more easily when in warm moist
atmosphere. Work is done much more rapidly in cool dry
air and the efficiency of the worker is noticeably raised; in
warm damp air the bodily temperature rises and the pulse
rate increases.</p>

<p>Mental and physical activities are reduced in an atmosphere
of high humidity and increased temperature. This is due
mainly to the reluctance on the part of the individual to put
forth an effort sufficient to perform any great amount of
work. There is a general feeling of languor because of the
enervating effect of the air.</p>

<p>There is no serious injury resulting from working in such
an atmosphere, unless there is an increase in the bodily temperature,
and then there may be serious results to the health
unless relief is obtained. When the humidity has reached the
point of complete saturation and the temperature is above
88° F., compensation can no longer obtain through evaporation
and heat stroke may result. The most noticeable effect
of warm moist air under ordinary circumstances is reluctance
to put forth any mental or physical exertion, and a loss of
appetite. With a temperature at 75° F. and the relative
humidity 80%, an individual not accustomed to such will
require complete rest.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that under such conditions Innate Intelligence
is constantly working to bring about intellectual adaptation
and that she is able to do so to a remarkable degree.
The glands of the body are used to produce secretions which
constantly bathe the tissues and keep them cool in the high
temperatures, and at a proper degree of warmth in the low
temperatures. The fact that the individual is indisposed to
mental and physical activity in such an atmosphere is adaptative<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
on the part of Innate. This inactivity is suggested by
means of the languid feeling in order that the body will not
be over-exercised and thus will not increase the amount of
heat in the body; because under these circumstances the
process of evaporation is interfered with and this is one of
Innate’s principal means of regulating the temperature of
the body.</p>

<p>Perspiration is an adaptation on the part of Innate, for
in this way the surface of the body is kept moist and as this
moisture evaporates the body is cooled; otherwise the temperature
of the body would increase with every rise in the
temperature of the atmosphere. Not only does this help to
regulate the bodily temperature, but it keeps the surface tissue
of the body soft. If there was no perspiration, the surface of
the body would soon become dry, parched and hard. The
skin would become scaly and would crack and become chafed.</p>

<p>Because of these adaptative processes it is possible for the
body to be adjusted to great extremes in temperature. The
body may become accustomed to extremely high temperatures
even with high relative humidity, providing the change takes
place gradually and sufficient time is allowed for the processes
of adaptation to take place.</p>

<p>It is very important that the kidneys be able to perform
their normal function in order that these processes of adaptation
may take place. The kidneys are important not only
because of the function which they perform in the excretion
of poisons, but because of the function which they perform
in relation to the serous circulation. This is important because
of the secretions that are involved. This subject will be
treated more fully under the subject of Water.</p>


<h3>Cold Damp Air</h3>

<p>The body quickly becomes chilled in a cold damp air
because the increase in the water vapor increases the conductivity
of the air for heat. It can thus be seen that the heat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
producing processes of the body must be increased in order
to maintain the normal temperature of the body. As we
know, all activity of the body requires an expenditure of
energy, so if the body is exposed to a cold damp air for an
abnormal length of time it will necessitate an increased
expenditure of internal energy to meet the increased demands
for heat and thus dissipate forces that should and would,
under normal conditions, be utilized in the metabolism of
the body. If the heat production is at a minimum in the
body, which it may be, due to several factors such as old age,
infancy, or dis-ease, this exposure to lowered temperature
and high humidity will result in injury to the body.</p>

<p>An interference with the transmission of mental impulses
to the kidneys resulting in a decrease in their functional
activity may mean a retention of poisons in the body and
produce a condition diagnosed as rheumatism, for example; or
an interference with the serous circulation may result in the
tissue cells being under-nourished. Both of these conditions
will interfere with the processes of intellectual adaptation.
Educationally, man may help in the adaptation by proper
clothing and by giving attention to proper exercise.</p>


<h3>Warm Dry Air</h3>

<p>By far the most desirable air is the warm, relatively dry
air; but as has already been noted, it is possible to have an
atmosphere with a relative humidity that is too low. If the
air is abnormally dry, and at the same time warm, there will
be a great loss of body moisture due to the increased evaporation.
When the loss of water from the body reaches 21%
death ensues. In an experiment performed by Rubner and
Lewaschew it was found that a man weighing about 127
pounds gave off about 54.1 grams of water in an hour in a temperature
of 68° F. with a relative humidity of 82%; the same
individual in a temperature of 68° F., but with a relative
humidity of 82%, gave off only 15.3 grams.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span></p>


<h3>Proper Temperature and Humidity</h3>

<p>The most desirable atmospheric conditions are obtained
at a temperature of 68° F. to 70° F., with the relative humidity
from 40% to 60%. This is given only as a general average
and will necessarily vary with many conditions, such as seasons
of the year and occupation.</p>

<p>Moderately cool and relatively dry air increases the activities
of the body, makes breathing easy and more frequent,
and hence increases the circulation of the blood. Innate is
thus enabled, in such an atmosphere, to bring about more
perfect metabolism.</p>

<p>Proper temperature and humidity of the air in houses,
impurities found therein, source of impurities and their effect
upon health, will all be considered thoroughly under Hygienic
Housing.</p>

<p class="center no-indent fs120 bold">VENTILATION</p>


<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Ventilation as defined by Webster is, “To cause fresh air
to circulate; to cause inside resident impure air to be removed
and replaced with fresh, pure air, whether it be in building,
streets, mines, or sewers.”</p>

<p>Shakespeare speaks of sleep as “Nature’s second course.”
Fresh air may well be called “Nature’s tonic.” Everything
else necessary for good health may be provided, but if there
is not a sufficient amount of fresh air the tissues of the body
can not perform their functions. It is quite as necessary to
have plenty of fresh, pure air as it is to have a proper amount
of wholesome food and pure water. Ordinarily not enough
attention is given the subject of ventilation, especially of the
average home.</p>

<p>The average adult breathes at the rate of seventeen or
eighteen respirations per minute. At each respiration about
thirty cubic inches of air passes in and out of the lungs. The
air in the lungs loses 4% of oxygen and absorbs about 3.5%
to 4% carbon dioxide. The nitrogen remains the same. The
temperature of expired air is raised to about 98.4% F. and
contains approximately 5% aqueous vapor.</p>

<p>This volume of air inspired and expired during gentle
respiration, which is, as has been said, about thirty cubic
inches, is known as tidal air. By forced inspiration another
100 cubic inches of air in addition to the tidal air may be
taken into the lungs. This is known as complemental air.
By forced expiration it is possible to expel from the lungs
100 cubic inches of air over and above the 30 cubic inches of
tidal air; this is known as the supplemental air. There is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
another 100 cubic inches which can not be expelled by the
most violent expiration; this is the residual air. The supplemental
air can, by forced expiration, be expelled from the
lungs, but the residual air can not. Altogether there is in
the lungs during forced inspiration about 330 cubic inches of
air. An average adult gives off about 0.71 cubic feet of carbon
dioxide per hour.</p>

<p>Taking into consideration the amount of air breathed into
the lungs per hour and the amount of impurities carried into
the breathing zone by the expired air, it can readily be seen
that the problem of supplying a sufficient volume of pure air
in the house is no small problem.</p>

<p>The amount of fresh air needed for the average adult is
estimated to be 3,000 cubic feet per hour. The ventilating
system that does not provide this amount of air per hour
without objectionable draughts does not meet the requirements
of modern hygiene.</p>

<p>In a system of ventilation it is not only a question of providing
a certain volume of air from the outside, but the great
problem is to provide a sufficient volume of pure air of proper
temperature and of proper humidity. Air that is laden with
smoke, dust and suspended matter, or that which contains
gas or foul odors, is objectionable and does not meet the
requirements. Therefore, the source of the air becomes important.
The ventilating system must also keep the air in
proper circulation at a proper velocity.</p>

<p>The ventilating system of an ordinary building might
seem a very simple proposition, but when considered carefully
it is a very great problem and one that requires the
careful attention of engineers trained in that particular line.</p>

<p>It is not the object of ventilation to provide an indoor
condition identical with that outdoors, but it is to maintain
a condition indoors conducive to a normal expression of indoor
life. It is quite obvious that if indoor conditions were maintained
identical with outdoor conditions the desired results<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
could not possibly be obtained, for indoor life demands a
much different environment. It is necessary to give any
system of ventilation as much attention as is given a heating
system in order to obtain the best results. No system will
work itself.</p>


<h3>Sources of Impurities in Air</h3>

<p>There are many processes carried on within the house
that add to the impurities of the air. Such sources may be
classified as follows: respiration of persons, impurities from
heating and illumination, and accidental sources from processes
carried on within the house, such as house cleaning and
laundering.</p>

<p>It will be observed from a study of the amount of air
inspired and expired and the impurities carried from the body
in the process that one of the most common sources of vitiation
of the air in houses is respiration. That these expired
poisons may be diluted or carried out of the breathing zone
it becomes necessary to have an adequate ventilating system.
If the room is heated by a stove impurities will be added from
coal dust and the dust of ashes. When the iron is overheated
it gives off carbon dioxide and other gases. Open fire or an
open blaze for lighting purposes consumes oxygen, gives off
carbon dioxide, raises the temperature and increases the
amount of aqueous vapor.</p>

<p>Vitiation from accidental sources consists of dust particles
of organic and inorganic detritus which are added to the air
from walls, floors, furniture and hangings. Other processes
such as laundering will add a certain amount of poisons and
suspended matter to the air. All this reveals the necessity
for exchanging the inside air for pure outside air.</p>


<h3>Requirements of a Ventilating System</h3>

<p>A ventilating system must not only bring about an exchange
of air, but it must also keep the inside air in proper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
circulation during the time it is contained inside. Proper
circulation of air is one of the most important functions of
ventilating systems.</p>

<p>The value of air circulation will be appreciated when it is
known that an aerial envelope is formed around the body
when the air is not kept moving and the temperature and
humidity of this air will resemble that of a very hot, humid
summer day. The effects will also be similar to those of
heat exhaustion. This shows the importance of keeping the
air in circulation in order to carry away the poisons that are
being constantly excreted from the skin and through the
respiratory tract.</p>

<p>The effects of foul air are usually manifested as headache,
fatigue, lassitude, vertigo, nausea, vomiting, collapse and even
death. The chronic effects are anemia, debility, lowered
vitality and disturbances in digestion. Prolonged exposure
to vitiated air will necessitate increased adaptation on the part
of Innate Intelligence. If this exposure is carried to an excess
it will draw upon the adaptative forces of the body and make
it more susceptible to the invasion of toxins and subject to
changes which it would not be when under more natural
environmental conditions.</p>

<p>It is now affirmed by the best hygienists that there is no
great objection to rebreathing air if provision is made for
diffusion of the carbon dioxide and if the bodily odors are
eliminated. In this way air may be properly warmed and
kept recirculating; thus there is a saving on fuel. If air is
to be rebreathed it must first be washed. There is, of course,
a limit to the length of time air can be recirculated. At no
time is the recirculated air equal to outside air and because
this method is not properly regulated and carefully controlled
it is not considered safe for use.</p>

<p>Before considering methods for obtaining pure air it is
interesting to look at Nature’s purifying system. The effect
of vegetation upon the air is to consume carbon dioxide,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
especially in the sunlight. The purifying effects of the sun’s
rays on the organic particles, the washing of the air by the
rain which carries down the dissolved gases and suspended
impurities, the natural constant diffusion of the air due to the
wind, are all natural processes tending to keep the outside
air in a state of purity.</p>

<p>Man so far has been unable to find any artificial means
of purifying the air and therefore must provide means of
admitting air from the outside in a state conducive to sustaining
indoor life.</p>


<h3>Natural Means of Ventilation</h3>

<p>Outside air may be polluted with dust, smoke and suspended
matter and it is then necessary to free the air of
these impurities before it enters the house. Especially is
this true in cities and where large buildings are to be ventilated.
The most satisfactory methods of ventilating a large
building is the plenum and the vacuum systems.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp45" id="image069" style="max-width: 54.125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image069.jpg" alt="Window Ventilation.">
</figure>

<p>In the ordinary home, ventilation is through the natural
openings such as windows and doors, although special openings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
may be provided which will admit fresh air and carry
out the vitiated air. A great deal of air is admitted through
the crevice and openings around windows and doors. A very
simple method of airing a room in cold weather when a direct
draught is objectionable is to place a board a few inches
wide and as long as the width of the window beneath the
lower sash. This prevents the air from coming through the
open window, but permits it to enter between the upper and
lower sashes. This also has the advantage of directing the
air current toward the ceiling. This is very effective in the
sick room and is so simple that any one can use it.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp45" id="image070" style="max-width: 52.8125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image070.jpg" alt="Window Mopper">
</figure>

<p>The size and shape of the room to be ventilated must be
taken into consideration as well as the number of persons
therein. The minimum amount of space allowed for each
person has been placed by various authors at from 300 to
1,000 cubic feet, depending upon the nature of the work
carried on, the size and shape of the room and the type of
ventilation depended upon. In hospitals where fever cases<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
are cared for 2,500 cubic feet are desired, while in government
barracks each soldier is allowed 600 cubic feet.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp45" id="image071" style="max-width: 33.6875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image071.jpg" alt="Window Ventilation">
</figure>

<p>The necessity for a sufficient supply of pure air can not
be over-emphasized. When the windows and doors are used
to ventilate the house they should be thrown open at different
times so that the house air may be completely changed. We
must not, however, go to the other extreme and jeopardize
the health of the occupants by keeping the temperature too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
low, yet it has been proven that cool, fresh air is more easily
heated than warm vitiated air.</p>

<p>When air is admitted by special ducts they should be so
arranged that air may be evenly distributed over the room.
The relative position of the inlets to the outlets is a question
upon which the engineers are not exactly agreed. It is
obvious, however, that their arrangement must admit of a
complete change of air at proper intervals and that draughts
will not be established directly between inlets and outlets.
It is generally conceded that the best results are obtained
when the inlet is placed above near the ceiling, and the outlet
placed directly below near the floor. In this way there seems
to be a more equitable distribution of the entering air and
less likelihood of a direct draught between the inlet and
outlet. The outlet should never be directly opposite the
inlet, since the air will pass directly through the room and
there will be very little mixing with the room air. If the
room is crowded it is more desirable to admit the fresh air
from beneath, but when this is done there must be a great
number of inlets. In this way the fresh air is admitted more
directly into the breathing zone and at the same time
advantage is taken of the natural air currents in the room.</p>

<p>There are many patent devices on the market for ventilating
through the windows. Such devices are very good
and may be used to an advantage. Usually they are so built
that the air is directed toward the ceiling as it is admitted.
The same desired end is accomplished by placing a board
under the lower sash as described above.</p>


<h3>Mechanical Ventilation</h3>

<p>By far the most satisfactory method of ventilating large
buildings is the mechanical method. This is not practical for
small buildings or homes because of the special devices that
are required and the expense of operation. Mechanical ventilation
may be accomplished by the plenum system, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
vacuum system, or by the combined plenum and vacuum systems.
The most desirable results are obtained when both
systems are used and used in connection with the heating system.
Heating and ventilating are so closely related that they
must be considered one with the other. A poorly ventilated
room is more difficult to heat and an improperly heated room
is difficult to ventilate.</p>

<p>The <b>plenum system</b> consists of a fan to force the air into
the rooms. These fans are run by water motors or electricity
whereby the air is forced through ducts into the rooms. This
system is made necessary by the great buildings, basements
and large steamships, which could not be inhabited if natural
ventilation was the only method employed.</p>

<p>The <b>vacuum system</b> consists of suction fans whereby the
vitiated air is drawn out of the rooms and replaced by fresh
air through the natural openings. In this way natural ventilation
may be made more efficient, but this method in itself
is not adequate for large buildings.</p>

<p>The two systems, vacuum and plenum, are commonly used
together and when employed in connection with the heating
device the very best results are obtained. The amount of air,
the temperature and humidity, and the purity of the air may
be regulated to a nicety in this way.</p>

<p>A complete system of <b>vacuum and plenum</b> consists of
plenum fans for forcing the air into the rooms, vacuum or
suction fans for the removal of vitiated air, the ducts for conducting
the air to and from the rooms, the necessary machinery
to run the fans, and a proper heating system whereby the air
may be warmed in the winter and cooled by ice coils in the
summer. It is also necessary to have a device for washing
the air.</p>


<h3>Washing the Air</h3>

<p>As the air is drawn into the buildings by the plenum fan
it is passed through a chamber where it is washed. This is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>done by forcing the air through a spray of water. A water
curtain is formed by forcing water through perforated pipes
placed across the chamber from each other and the water
thus sprayed made to intercept. As the air passes through
this curtain of water many of the impurities such as dust,
cinders, bacteria, some of the gases, particles of decomposition,
and epithelial cells, are removed. Washing does not remove
carbon dioxide or bodily odors. Washing is one of Nature’s
methods of cleaning the air as is seen in rain.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/image074.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent"><em>Central heating with washed air.</em></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>After the air is washed it is passed over tempering coils.
In the winter the air is warmed and in the summer it is
cooled in this way. The humidity is also controlled. It can
thus be seen that this method, although rather expensive, is
the only real method of ventilating large buildings satisfactorily.</p>

<p class="center no-indent">HEATING</p>

<h2>GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS</h2>


<h3>Heat from Hygienic Standpoint</h3>

<p>The subjects of heating, lighting and ventilating will be
treated purely from a hygienic standpoint and in no sense
from the standpoint of engineering. The proper manner of
heating a building is not within the scope of hygiene, but
becomes a question of proper engineering and a subject to
be considered from that angle. We are concerned only as
the heating of buildings influences the health of the occupants.</p>


<h3>Combustion</h3>

<p>In parts of the country where the temperature goes below
60° F. it becomes necessary to provide artificial heat to warm
houses in order that health may be maintained at the least
possible expenditure of energy. The most common method
of producing heat for heating purposes is by combustion. Its
obedience to certain physical laws is infallible. Heat is liberated
from such material as coal and wood by combustion
and is the result of the chemical action of this combustion;
it is then transmitted to the rooms to be heated either by air,
water, or steam unless the combustion takes place in the room
to be heated; then it is distributed throughout the room by
radiation from the open fire or conduction from above.</p>


<h3>Molecular Theory</h3>

<p>Up until the beginning of the nineteenth century heat was
believed to be a substance that had no weight and the name
caloric was given this hypothetical substance. Davy and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
Rumford, through a series of experiments, proved that heat
is a violent agitation of the molecules of matter. From this
we have the molecular theory that as the velocity of the
molecules is increased heat is produced and the temperature
raised. The words heat and temperature are not interchangeable.
Heat is the cause and temperature is the effect.
Temperature indicates the presence of heat and the degree
of temperature represents the intensity of the heat, but not
the quantity. Heat in the same amount may be imparted to
two bodies of the same substances, but different mass, and
one will be hotter than the other; therefore, the specific heats
of the two substances are different. To illustrate: Place in
the sun a receptacle containing two gallons of water and one
containing one gallon of water, both the same temperature.
Leave them for a given length of time and they will become
warm, but the one gallon will be warmer than the two, because
of the difference in the amount of water to be warmed. The
same amount of heat was applied to each, but this did not
produce the same temperature in both. Again the same
quantity of different substances may be exposed to the same
heat, but the temperature will not necessarily be the same, for
some substances heat more rapidly than others. It requires
more heat to raise the temperature of water to a given degree
than it does the same weight of any other substance, except
hydrogen. This is the reason water gives off more heat than
any other substance that cools through the same number of
degrees.</p>

<p>Normal heat is produced in the body by the expression of
calorific mental impulses and by the oxidation which is carried
on in the tissue cells. The amount of heat produced in the
body is adaptative to the needs of the body and is under the
direct control of Innate Intelligence.</p>

<p>Air is carried into the lungs in respiration and by the action
of Innate the oxygen is absorbed in the air cells and passes
into the blood. It is carried in the blood by the hemoglobin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
to the tissue cells where it comes in contact with the calorific
mental impulses and combustion takes place.</p>


<h3>Body Heat</h3>

<p>The normal bodily temperature is 98.6° F. Variation above
or below this point indicates abnormality. This heat can not
be supplied artificially from without. It must be generated
within the body. It therefore becomes obvious that the temperature
outside of the body is not regulated for the purpose
of supplying the body with heat. The temperature of the
atmosphere must, however, be regulated in order that there
may not be an abnormal loss of the bodily heat. The bodily
heat is being constantly lost to the outside air as follows:
30% by contact with the air, about 43% by radiation and
about 27% by exhalation and other losses. We may sit in a
room that is warm enough, say 75° F., and yet if we are near
a cold wall we will feel chilly. We say we feel the cold
coming from the wall, while in reality we feel chilly and cold
because the body is losing its heat abnormally to the cold
wall by radiation through the air.</p>

<p>When the air is comparatively dry the equality of the
bodily heat is maintained by a steady but imperceptible
evaporation from the skin. In moist air this evaporation does
not take place so readily since the air is already laden with
moisture, so instead of the moisture being absorbed by the
air it forms on the surface of the body as perspiration. This
is why one perspires more in a moist air than in an atmosphere
having a low humidity. When the air is kept in constant
motion there is an increase both in the evaporation from the
surface of the body and also in the heat conduction by the
constant supply of fresh air to take the place of the moisture-laden
and heated air around the body.</p>

<p>The normal heat given off from the body raises the temperature
of the air surrounding the body and tends to create
upward currents. This is Nature’s method in freeing the body<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
from the envelope of vitiated air which surrounds it as a result
of the natural processes carried on through it. Therefore, if
the temperature of the room is too nearly the same as that
of the body it will be necessary to make more provision for
the ventilation since the temperature of the body would not
be enough greater than that of the surrounding air to create
sufficient movement to carry the vitiated air away from the
body. That is why a cool room does not require the same
amount of ventilation that a hot room does.</p>

<p>Innate Intelligence is capable of adapting the heat of the
body to a great range in atmospheric temperature, but in order
to do this there must be a sufficient length of time to enable
Innate to bring about the necessary adaptative changes in the
body. If the atmospheric changes take place too rapidly this
adaptation cannot be effected and the metabolic equilibrium
of the body will be disturbed. This makes it necessary to
exercise care in properly heating our dwellings.</p>


<h3>Proper Temperature of Building</h3>

<p>It is certain that temperature of the dwelling should be
properly regulated and that it should not vary with the temperature
outdoors, especially in the winter time. The heat
equilibrium of the body may be easily disturbed by sudden
changes in the temperature of the dwelling. Because there
is an increased expenditure of the internal energy to bring
about adaptation, the internal forces are dissipated and this
lowers the resistance of the body and makes the individual
susceptible to incoördination.</p>

<p>A high temperature with a relatively low percentage of
humidity will cause an abnormal evaporation from the skin
and mucous membrane. This gives not only a sense of chilliness
but causes an abnormal dryness of the skin and produces
an irritation in the throat and nose. On the contrary, the
bodily heat will be withdrawn too rapidly in a temperature
that is too low.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span></p>

<p>There are many factors to consider in determining the
proper temperature of a room or a dwelling. The time of
year, the processes carried on within the dwelling, the use of
the rooms—that is, whether they are used for sleeping-rooms,
living-rooms, or workrooms—all tend to influence the degree
of temperature most advantageous to the inmates of the room.</p>

<p>In determining the proper temperature of a room the relative
humidity that is to be maintained must be considered.
A hot dry air is more desirable than a cool damp air. In
winter the variation in the temperature of the average dwelling
should be between 58° F. and 70° F. with a relative humidity
of 40% to 60%. The temperature should be lower in the
bedroom than in the living-room.</p>

<p>The great objection to the average heating system is that
the air is kept too dry; therefore, it is necessary to keep the
temperature of the rooms too high in order for the individuals
to keep warm.</p>


<h3>Requirements for Heating System</h3>

<p>In order for a system of heating to meet the demands of
hygiene there must be a minimum cost of production and
absence of impurities produced in the process of heat; the
heat must be equitably distributed over the house; the temperature
must be kept even, thus insuring continuous heating;
and there must be a proper degree of humidity. There must
also be freedom from explosions and danger from fire.</p>

<p>There are three methods of heating; radiation, conduction
and convection. There are two systems by which these
methods are used: they are local and central. In local systems
the heat is produced in the room by combustion or burning
of fuel in grates and stoves.</p>

<p>In central heating the heat is produced at a central place
outside of the rooms and conveyed to them by hot air, hot
water or steam.</p>

<p>Even though these three methods of heating are usually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
given, it is difficult to draw hard and fast lines of demarcation
between the different methods, for, as a matter of fact, they
overlap to quite an extent. The element of radiation is involved
in both conduction and convection.</p>


<h2>LOCAL HEATING</h2>


<h3>Radiation</h3>

<p>The vibrating molecules of a heated substance will set into
motion the ether of space and in this way the heat may be
transmitted as wave motion. We have an illustration of this
in the transmission of heat to the earth from the sun. Ether
waves are generated by the violent vibration of the molecules
of the sun and the vibrations are transmitted to the earth and
they in turn generate molecular vibrations of the bodies of
the earth. This is spoken of as radiant heat and is illustrated
by the heat from the open fireplace.</p>

<p>Open fireplaces give off heat by direct radiation. This
is the oldest method of heating and has been in use for
many generations. It is not a satisfactory method, however.
The radiation of heat takes place through air very
readily, but air is not a good conductor of heat. Heat may be
radiated from the body very rapidly through the air to cold
objects. As for instance, sitting near a cold wall one will
feel chilly due to the radiation of the heat from the body to
the cold wall, although the air in the room may be sufficiently
warm to be otherwise comfortable.</p>

<p>Heat may be readily radiated from an open fire, but it must
be remembered that the intensity of the radiated heat is
inversely proportional to the distance of the heated object
from the place where the heat is produced. To illustrate:
If one object is one foot from the source of heat, the open
fireplace, and another object is three feet from the fireplace,
the object that is farther away will receive only one-ninth
as much heat as the one nearer. This is one of the disadvantages
of the open fireplace as a means of heating a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
room. A fireplace is very cheery and gives a room a comfortable
appearance and is very popular in the modern home.
It is adequate to take the chill away when the weather is
not very cold, but it is certainly a very undesirable means of
heating a house in cold weather.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="image085" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image085.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent"><em>Local Heating</em></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Another objection to the open fireplace is that it requires
a great deal of fuel. About 75% of the heat is lost through
the chimney. There is, however, an advantage in the open<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
fireplace since it affords an excellent means for ventilation;
there is always a draft up the chimney.</p>


<h3>Conduction</h3>

<p>Heat is carried through such metals as iron by molecular
action and such heat transference is known as conduction.
The fact that heat is transferred through metals by conduction
is of vital significance in the question of heat losses and dissipation,
as through walls of buildings for example.</p>

<p>If heat be applied to any part of an iron bar or piece of
metal it will be transferred to all parts of that iron by the
molecular action until it is all heated. This can be illustrated
nicely by placing the end of the poker in the furnace fire and
in a short time the heat will be felt in the other end of the
poker.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="image086" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image086.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent"><em>Undesirable Local Heating</em></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The <b>stove</b> is a good example of the conduction of heating.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
The heat is conducted through the iron of the stove to the
air in the room, and then by convection through the air to
all parts of the room. The molecules that are in contact with
the fire first have their motion accelerated by the heat and
this motion is passed from molecule to molecule until all the
molecules in the entire iron are accelerated in their motion
and thus the temperature of the metal is increased. Some
metals are better conductors of heat than others, owing to
the difference in the character of the connection between the
molecules. Silver forms the best conductor of heat among
the metals and is used as a standard of conductivity.</p>

<p>In conduction heat is produced inside a fire pot, as in a
stove, and conducted through the iron then radiated from its
outer surface. This is also called indirect radiation and is a
more satisfactory method than the direct radiation since the
material of the stove will retain the heat for a longer period
of time and allow for its more equitable distribution. In this
way it is possible to heat the room more evenly than with an
open fire.</p>

<p>One of the objections to this method is that it is local and
has all the disadvantages of a local heating system. The combustion
takes place in the room and as a result there are
certain amounts of impurities that are admitted into the
breathing zone. There is the added disadvantage of having
dirt and dust from the fuel and from the ashes and refuse
from the process of combustion. These disadvantages are
not encountered in a central system.</p>

<p>In extremely cold weather the stoves are likely to become
overheated in an effort to keep the rooms warm, and overheated
stoves not only increase the hazard from fires, but tend
to scorch the air. Red hot iron consumes oxygen and gives
off carbon dioxide which produces an unfit atmosphere for
breathing. It is difficult to maintain an even heat in a room
that is heated by a stove for the stove requires a great amount
of attention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span></p>


<h2>CENTRAL HEATING</h2>


<h3>Convection</h3>

<p>The most desirable system of heating is the central. In
this system the heat is conveyed from the central heating
plant to the rooms either by air, hot water, or steam. The
heat may be produced in the house that is to be heated, usually
in the basement, or it may be produced at a distance, as in
the case of steam plants, and carried through pipes to the
house. There are three principal systems of central heating:
Hot air, hot water, and steam.</p>

<p>Heat is carried through air by convection. The air exposed
to heat becomes specifically lighter and hence rises and
the cooler air takes its place. In this way the air of a room
is heated by its constant movement brought about by this
phenomenon. The air becomes heated in the air jacket of
the hot air furnace and creates an upward draft. As soon as
the cool air rushes downward to take its place a downward
draft is formed through the cold air ducts. In this way the
air in the room is kept in circulation and at the same time
properly warmed.</p>

<p><b>Hot air</b>, or as it is sometimes called, furnace heating, is a
very satisfactory system for an ordinary dwelling or small
building. It consists of a large stove much as that used in
local heating. Surrounding this stove is a jacket with an air
space between it and the stove. Pipes lead from the air space
through the top of this jacket and convey the air that is
heated by the stove to the different rooms. The cold air is
taken from the rooms and conveyed through the cold air
pipes back to the furnace and is admitted to the air jacket
from beneath. In this way the warm air, being lighter than
the cold air, passes upward through the hot air pipes and is
replaced by the cold air through the cold air pipes. In this
way there is a constant circulation of air through the pipes.</p>

<p>This kind of a furnace requires much attention, but not as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
much as a local heating stove. Great care must be taken that
the air is not overheated in the air jacket. If it is, the air in
the room will be dry and stuffy and may even have a scorched
odor. The furnace should be equipped with a water receptacle
inside the air jacket. This receptacle should be kept full and
in this way a proper relative humidity will be maintained. If
this is not done, the air in the room will be too dry and it
will require a higher temperature to keep the room comfortable.
Another objection to this system is that dust and
dirt are likely to enter the rooms from the furnace.</p>

<p>The <b>hot water</b> is a very desirable system of heating.
Heat convection through water is practically the same as
that through air. The particles of water at the point where
the heat is applied become lighter as they become heated and
because of this change naturally rise to the top and the
particles that are cooler and therefore heavier sink to the
bottom, thus forming currents. For this reason water heats
much more rapidly when the heat is applied to the bottom
than it does when heat is applied at the top of the receptacle.
These principles are utilized in hot water systems. The hot
water rises in the radiators and gives off its heat to the cooler
atmosphere and the cool water returns to the boiler to be
reheated. In this way there is a constant circulation of the
water through the system.</p>

<p>The hot air system is entirely satisfactory for small buildings,
but is not so desirable for large buildings. For large
dwellings and public buildings the hot water system is much
more satisfactory. In the hot water system a water jacket
is provided instead of an air jacket. The water is carried
from the boiler over the fire box through pipes to the different
rooms where it passes through radiators and is returned to
the boiler by continuous pipes. At the top of the pipes an
expansion tank is placed to take care of the expansion of
the water when heated. The heated water circulates freely
through the system of pipes. Each radiator is provided with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
a valve to regulate the amount of water admitted and in this
way the degree of heat may be regulated in the different rooms.
Each radiator is provided with an air valve to allow the air to
escape when the water is admitted, or to allow the steam to
escape in case the system becomes overheated and the water
is converted into steam.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp45" id="image090" style="max-width: 46.0625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image090.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent"><em>Central Heating
Showing boiler, pipes,
and radiators.</em></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This system is easily cared for and easily operated. It
requires a relatively small amount of coal and maintains a
very even heat, and when properly operated there will be no
sudden changes in the temperature of the rooms. There is
less danger of overheating the air and lowering the humidity
with this system than with the hot air furnace.</p>

<p>The radiators may be placed in the rooms that are to be
heated or they may be placed in the basement and the air
admitted and passed over the radiator and warmed and then
forced into the rooms. This is known as the indirect method<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
and is used in connection with the system of ventilation.
It is used more with steam than with hot water.</p>

<p>Heating by <b>steam</b> is by far the most satisfactory method,
especially for larger dwellings and buildings. This system is
somewhat like that of hot water, except the water is converted
into steam. The temperature of the pipes and radiators is
therefore higher than with hot water, but the pipes and
radiators do not need to be as large.</p>

<p>Very often this system is used in connection with the
ventilation. The radiators are placed in the basement or in
another convenient place and cool fresh air from the outside
is passed over them and warmed. It is then forced into the
rooms. Very often this air is washed, as described in the
chapter on ventilation, and thus freed from suspended matter.
At the same time the relative humidity can be controlled and
this is very essential, not only as a means of providing air
that is most desirable for breathing, but also in point of fuel
economy, since air of high humidity is more easily heated and
is more desirable in conserving the heat of the body as has
already been explained. Steam heating is especially suitable
for high and irregularly shaped buildings. The fact that the
radiators and pipes are empty when not in use reduces the
risk of damage to the house furnishings from bursted or leaky
pipes.</p>

<p>It is well to have the radiators placed near windows so
that in ventilating the air will pass over them and be warmed
before entering the room.</p>

<h3>Adaptability of Eye to Light</h3>

<p>The eye has a great range of adaptability to the intensity
of light. This is evidenced by the fact that the eye is readily
adapted to the intensity of the bright sunlight or to the soft
rays of the moon. In both instances there is no disturbance
in vision, even though the intensity of illumination at midday
when the light is brightest is almost a million times greater
than the illumination from the full moon on a clear night.
This adaptation takes place so perfectly and so independent
of the educated mind that we give little thought to the great
difference in intensity of light.</p>

<p>It must be remembered, however, that although this adaptation
takes place so perfectly and without any apparent
difficulty, it requires an expenditure of Innate force to accomplish
this action. If the change takes place too rapidly from
a soft light to an intense light, without sufficient time for
adaptative action to take place, the delicate structure of the
eye will be damaged by the violent light vibrations. The
change from the soft rays of the moonlight to the intense
illumination from the bright sun takes place gradually. First,
the night; next, the gray dawn of morning; and then comes
the sun, whose rays are softened as they pass through a
maximum amount of atmosphere near the horizon, and as the
sun approaches the dome of the arc, the rays become more
intense, since they pass through less of the earth’s atmosphere.
Then the process is reversed as the intense light from the
sun gives way to the softer rays from the moon.</p>

<p>This gives Innate plenty of time to bring about the adaptative
processes so necessary to adjust the eye to these extremes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
time being a very important factor in all the processes of
the body.</p>

<p>Thus it is appreciated that the subject of lighting is important
from a hygienic standpoint, since improper lighting
necessitates an unnecessary expenditure of energy and causes
impaired health.</p>


<h3>The Eye</h3>

<p>That we may better appreciate this adaptability and have
a clearer understanding of the mechanism through which
Innate Intelligence accomplishes this adaptative action we
will review briefly the organ through which we perceive
light—the human eye.</p>

<p>The eye consists of a crystalline lens, powerfully refractive,
held between two transparent liquids called the aqueous
humor, which is in front of the crystalline lens and the vitreous
humor, which is behind or posterior to the crystalline lens.
The aqueous chamber is divided into an anterior and posterior
chamber by the diaphragm called the iris, through which is
an opening called the pupil, permitting communication between
the chambers of the aqueous humor. The retina,
which is composed of nervous tissue, lines the posterior
five-sixths of the inner surface of the posterior wall of the
eyeball. At the back of the retina and in the direct visual
axis is a spot known as the macula lutea, a yellow spot,
in the center of which is a depression known as the fovea
centralis. At this point the vision is clearest and it is this
spot used when we turn our eyes and look directly at an
object.</p>

<p>With such a delicate instrument as the eye it is only reasonable
that special care and arrangement should be supplied
to protect it from sudden changes in the intensity of light.
Otherwise the eye would be greatly injured by the glare of
light. This adaptation is accomplished by means of regulating
the amount of light admitted to the retina. This is done<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
through the expression of Innate by regulating the size of
the pupil.</p>

<p>When the eye is exposed to light, vibrations are carried
to the brain through the afferent nerve fibers and Innate
Intelligence becomes aware of the light. If it is intense and
is allowed to remain in contact with the retina the delicate
nerve tissue will be injured. To compensate for this Innate
Intelligence sends motor impulses to the circular fibers in the
iris, causing them to contract and decrease the size of the
pupil and thus shut out a part of the light rays. In a less
intense light or in the darkness the muscular fibers are relaxed,
enlarging the pupil and admitting more light. In all
of this adaptative action there must be sufficient time,
although the action does take place almost instantly. This
action is not automatic as some would have us believe, but
is intelligent and under the direct control of Innate Intelligence.</p>

<p>If we were living in the natural state of man’s existence
there would be no need for a consideration of these natural
laws governing the working of the human body and the intelligence
which controls these manifestations; but as man
has increased his knowledge and has made for himself a more
or less artificial environment, it becomes necessary for him
to understand the natural laws that he may adapt his artificial
environment to them. If man lived in the open outdoors
there would be no need for the artificial lighting of buildings;
but since he has created buildings it becomes necessary for
him to study the laws of nature that he may produce a condition
in this environment conducive to the expression of life.
In providing artificial light for our buildings the laws of the
physical organ of sight must be considered. However, the
question of lighting is not alone one of artificial production
of light in our buildings, but also deals with proper admission
of natural light from natural sources.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span></p>


<h3>Value of Sunlight</h3>

<p>The value of the sunlight in respect to health has been
recognized from time immemorial. Direct rays of the sun
are essential in the development and expression of animal
and plant life. The sun’s rays are Nature’s greatest germicide.
They destroy almost all forms of germ life. Most of the
chemical reactions are hastened or induced by the action of
light. Light prevents or retards the development of the lower
forms of life but promotes the growth of the higher forms.</p>


<h3>Natural Light in Buildings</h3>

<p>From the foregoing statement it is quite obvious that a
proper amount of light, and if possible the direct rays of the
sun, must be admitted to the home if it is to afford an environment
at all conducive to the expression of life. It is therefore
necessary to make special provision for the admission
of light. The amount of light admitted to a building will be
determined by its location and aspect, the source of the light,
whether direct or reflected, the location and size of the openings,
and the kind of glass used. The character of the walls
and other inside surfaces will determine the light diffusion.</p>

<p>Since direct rays of the sun give more light than those
reflected, it is desirable to admit them to the house as much
as possible rather than to depend upon reflected light from
the surfaces outside, such as the trees and buildings.</p>

<p>There is a certain loss of light as it passes through window
glass. This loss is about 8% through plate glass while
through double glass the loss is 10%, and through milk glass
there is a loss of 50%. The amount of light in a room may
be increased by the use of prism or ribbed glass which results
in a more even distribution of light over the room.</p>

<p>The window area of rooms in a home should be not less
than 10% of the floor area, or not less than one square foot
of glass surface for every seventy cubic feet of interior to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
be lighted. This is not sufficient, however, for a schoolroom
or for factories. The schoolroom should have a window area
not less than one-fourth of the floor space.</p>

<p>Windows should be placed so as to admit direct rays of
the sun and should extend within six inches of the ceiling.
Window shades may be used to regulate the amount of light
admitted, but care should be exercised in keeping down the
dust, since it accumulates on the shades and is disturbed
when they are adjusted. The dust then gets into the breathing
zone and becomes objectionable from a hygienic standpoint.</p>


<h3>Artificial Lighting</h3>

<p>With the present day modern methods of artificial lighting
it seems there would be little difficulty in lighting our homes
and other buildings; but the question is not alone one of how
they are to be lighted, but also how this can best be accomplished
and not interfere with health and produce eye strain
and other conditions that are likely to follow improper
lighting.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note the evolution of the lighting systems
from the primitive man who carried a burning stick
from the campfire into his cave and thus realized the pleasure
of the privacy of his own dwelling, up to the modern lighting
systems. For centuries man burned wood and other materials
in their natural state and depended upon these for his illumination.
Then it was discovered that by dipping this raw
material in animal fat more light could be obtained. Later
the oil was placed in a container and a wick used. Then
from this crude grease lamp with its wick evolved the candle,
which was a great improvement over the former method.
And so mankind groped in comparative darkness through centuries.
It was not until the closing years of the nineteenth
century that he found a better means of illumination. In
1879 Edison brought out his wonderful invention, the electric<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
light. Even the evolution of this light would be interesting
for there have been many improvements over the original.</p>

<p>It is very obvious that the best method of lighting is by
the use of the incandescent electric light. It produces the
desired intensity, does not vitiate the air, requires little attention,
and is operated at a minimum expense.</p>

<p>The objections to the open blaze for illumination are that
oxygen is consumed from the air, carbon dioxide and other
impurities are given off, the light is not constant, since there
is a tendency to flicker and especially so in a draft, it requires
more attention, is unhandy to operate and does not give the
proper amount of illumination. Most of these objections are
overcome in the electric light.</p>

<p>The source of light must be so placed that it will not
strike the eyes directly. Care must be taken that there are
no surfaces reflecting light directly into the eyes. The lighting
system must provide illumination of sufficient intensity,
yet without a glare which produces eye strain. While our
modern methods of artificially producing light are a great
boon to civilization, they may also be a great detriment to
health to say nothing of the discomfort that is caused by
improper methods of lighting our homes, schools, and workshops.</p>


<h3>Psychological Effect of Light</h3>

<p>It is not out of order at this time to mention the effect of
light upon emotions of the human family. Proper illumination
is commensurate with the particular functions carried on
within the place illuminated. Note the soft light effects of
the cathedral and the influence it has on the people who visit
the place. Enter a church building with its “dim religious
light” and note the calming effect which it has on the assembly
Of worshippers. To be sure they have gathered in the place
for worship and are in that state of mind which would be
expected of those in a revered mood, yet there is no question<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
as to the influence of the surroundings and especially of the
lighting. It would be quite out of keeping to have the cathedral
as brilliantly lighted as the “Great White Way.” The
architecture, the furnishings and the lighting all have a certain
influence upon the minds of the individuals.</p>

<p>As the dim, soft light has a quieting influence so the bright,
dazzling light has a stimulating effect. This is observed in the
lighting of amusement places where the predominating feature
of the entertainment is hilarity. The pulse may be made to
beat faster, the thoughts turned from the serious things of life
to the less serious, and the mind made to desire the activities
of the pleasurable things of worldly enjoyment by the peculiar
environment and the intensity of the illumination. Or the
mind may be soothed into the tranquil moods and the entire
being made to surge with emotion, while the mind is directed
from the more frivolous subjects to the deepest thoughts of
the philosopher with a proper arranging of the surroundings
and a soothing and delicate lighting over all. While these
things do not bear directly upon the subject of hygiene in
the more commonly accepted way, yet they do have a certain
bearing upon health and the physiological functions of the
body, especially from the standpoint of environmental influence
upon the body and its adaptation through the action
of Innate Intelligence.</p>


<h3>Systems of Lighting</h3>

<p>Direct lighting is secured by fixtures which throw the light
downward into the room from which the eyes are protected
by properly adjusted shades. Indirect lighting is from bowl-like
fixtures in which electric lights are placed and the light
rays are reflected upward toward the ceiling with no light
penetrating the bowl. Semi-indirect is accomplished by using
a bowl which will permit some of the light rays to penetrate.</p>

<p>The best results are obtained by a combination of the
direct and indirect methods of lighting and in some cases by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
a semi-indirect way. It has been observed that the direct
rays of light should not fall squarely into the eyes. It is
also quite essential that in some cases there should be direct
rays on the work or object under observation. To accomplish
this and at the same time to keep the light out of the
eyes there must be a judicial use of shades and other means
of softening the light.</p>

<p>There are some objections to the indirect method in that
all the light is thrown on the ceiling. This gives a very soft
light in the room, but is not sufficiently bright and faces lose
their expression; there is insufficient modeling of objects, and
the interior will be almost devoid of character. This form of
lighting, therefore, is undesirable for home and offices, but is
not objectionable for places of amusement.</p>

<p>There are also objections to the direct system since the
strong direct light makes too harsh shadows and a light glare
which is very objectionable. By properly diffusing this direct
light and adding sufficient upward light we get a much more
effective and pleasing illumination.</p>

<p>By using the two systems, or better still, by combining the
two systems into the semi-indirect, a method is obtained which
will furnish an abundance of light and at the same time give
one that is so perfectly diffused there will be no objectionable
shadows and no harmful glare.</p>

<p>Insufficient light may be quite as injurious to the eyes as
too much light. As a matter of fact it is not so much a question
of too great an intensity as it is of the proper light direction;
it is hardly possible to get a light of greater intensity
than that of the sun, but we are very careful that the sun’s
direct rays do not enter the unprotected eye; neither is it
good to permit the reflection of the rays into the eyes, as
from a printed page.</p>

<p class="center no-indent">CHAPTER VII</p>

<p class="center no-indent fs120 bold">WATER</p>


<h2>GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS</h2>

<h3>Necessity for Proper Supply</h3>

<p>One of the most important requisites in maintaining the
organization of the material in the living body is a proper
supply of water. It is absolutely indispensable to the expression
of animal and vegetable life. Although not classed as a
food it enters into the composition of food and hence becomes
an essential article of diet.</p>

<p>The greatest value has always been placed upon a sufficient
supply of pure water. The history of the race shows
that the earliest settlements were made with a view to obtaining
a supply of water; they were either on waterways or in
places where water was easily obtainable from springs or
shallow wells.</p>

<p>Water is needed not only as an article of diet, but it is also
required for sanitary purposes: for cleansing the body externally,
for washing clothes, and also for sprinkling streets and
for other purposes such as sewage disposal in the thickly
populated centers. Even in ancient times great sums of money
were expended for the public supply of water.</p>


<h3>History of Public Water Supply</h3>

<p>A bit of history on this subject might be of interest to
some. It is asserted by historians that there are aqueducts
in China dating back to prehistoric times. Channels cut in
solid rock have been revealed in Jerusalem in recent excavation
which indicate that they were used for conveying the
water supply from the country near Bethlehem and Hebron.
There have been found in these excavations channels of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
earthen pipes cemented together and covered with rough
rocks. The fact is also quite well established that water was
brought to Athens from Mount Hymettos and Mount Pentelikon.</p>

<p>As early as 312 B. C. water was carried to Rome through
an aqueduct ten miles long. It is estimated that the cost of
construction of this aqueduct was about $12,700,000. Another
was begun in 272 B. C., the length of which was forty-five
miles. The water carried by this aqueduct was not used
for drinking but for irrigating purposes and for flushing drains.</p>

<p>Altogether there were at least nine aqueducts that supplied
the ancient city of Rome. Of these nine, three are still
used to supply modern Rome. One of these was finished by
Agrippa in 27 B. C.</p>

<p>We see by the foregoing that from time immemorial there
has been a great expenditure of energy and money in producing
a proper water supply for the human family. It also
reveals the fact that the ancients knew something about engineering
projects which some of us are likely to consider as
modern accomplishments.</p>


<h3>Composition of Water</h3>

<p>Water is not, as was previously supposed, an elementary
substance. In 1781 it was shown by Cavendish that it consisted
of two parts of hydrogen and one part of oxygen (H<sub>2</sub>O),
and that it could be made synthetically by combining hydrogen
and oxygen in this proportion, and that it could be separated
analytically by various methods into its component
parts.</p>

<p>By volume, water is composed of two parts of hydrogen
to one part of oxygen; by weight, one part of hydrogen to
eight parts of oxygen. However, pure water does not exist
in Nature since water is a universal solvent and in Nature
it comes in contact with so many substances; therefore, it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
contains many substances in solution. Chemically pure water
is found only in the chemist’s flask.</p>

<p>Water is a liquid which is clear, colorless and odorless.
To be palatable it should be cool, soft, well aerated and free
from sediment and suspended impurities. One cannot judge
the purity of water by any one of these qualities, for water
that is palatable and gives no offense upon drinking might be
polluted with that which would be detrimental to health. The
palatability of water may be due to the carbonic acid present,
which results from the decomposition of products contained
in it.</p>

<p>The carbon dioxide, which is present in rain water, is
obtained from the air through which the rain passes. Carbon
dioxide is also taken up by the water as it percolates through
ground covered with vegetation. The presence of this gas
increases the solvent powers of the water. Water may also
contain metal in solution such as iron, arsenic and copper.</p>

<p>The important foreign ingredients in water are those of
organic origin, such as microscopic plants, vegetable fungi,
detritus of vegetable life, minute insects, infusoria, ova of
insects, minute parasites, and animal debris. Water usually
contains millions of various micro-organisms, mostly harmless,
although at times it may also contain so-called pathogenic
germs.</p>


<h3>States of Aggregation</h3>

<p>Water is formed into the solid state, ice, at zero degrees
centigrade. At 100° C. water boils and is converted into gas
or vapor, although water is contained in the air in the gaseous
form at ordinary temperatures. Between these two limits,
0° C. and 100° C. water obtains in the liquid form which is
its most common state. Water is the most widely distributed
of all the substances. It is practically incompressible. When
heated it contracts until it reaches 4° C, or 39.2° F., and is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
at this point taken as the basis for specific gravity of liquids
and solids.</p>


<h3>Universal Solvent</h3>

<p>Water is the most universal solvent known in Nature.
Practically all substances yield to it. Most of the water taken
into the body passes through unchanged, although it is only
reasonable to suppose that some of it is broken up into its
elements and united with other compounds of the body.</p>


<h3>Necessity for Water in Body</h3>

<p>Water composes about 70% of the entire weight of the
body (about 58.5% per volume). A very great amount of
water is required by the tissue for the performance of the
bodily functions. As the gears of machinery must be bathed
in oil to prevent undue wear, so must the tissue cells be bathed
in water (secretions) that there be no undue wear. The tissue
cells are spoken of as being aquatic in their habits.</p>

<p>Rosenau in summarizing the use of water in the body
says: “It enters into the chemical composition of the tissues;
it forms the chief ingredient of all the fluids of the body and
maintains their proper degree of dilution, and thus favors
metabolism; by moistening various surfaces of the body, such
as mucous and serous membranes, it prevents friction; it
furnishes in the blood and lymph a fluid medium by which
food may be taken to remote parts of the body and the waste
material removed, thus promoting rapid tissue changes; it
serves as a distributor of bodily heat; it regulates the body
temperature by the physical process of absorption and evaporation.”</p>


<h3>Chemically Pure Water</h3>

<p>Chemically pure water can be obtained only by distillation;
it is undesirable, however, for drinking purposes because
of its insipidity. Before such water is agreeable for drinking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
it must be aerated; this may be accomplished by agitation or
by passing it through a porous substance containing air. One
of Nature’s methods of aerating water is found in mountain
streams where the water flows down over rocks. The same
thing is accomplished by fountains and waterfalls. It is the
mineral matter and the gases held in solution that give water
its taste, and it is the difference in these minerals and gases
that causes the individual to dislike the taste of water which
he is not accustomed to drinking. But this is purely a matter
of taste and has no value from a hygienic standpoint, for
the most impure water, water that contains so-called pathogenic
germs, may taste very good.</p>

<p>Turbid or muddy water is not necessarily impure from a
hygienic standpoint when found in rivers, but when subsoil
water becomes turbid it should be regarded with suspicion.</p>


<h3>Hard and Soft Water</h3>

<p>The question of hard and soft water is one that must of
necessity receive some consideration, but it is of more importance
from an economic standpoint than from a sanitary
standpoint. Soft water is generally considered to be more
desirable for drinking purposes, and it is certainly more
desirable for cooking. From an economical standpoint, soft
water is more preferable as the hard water requires more soap
to produce a lather.</p>

<p>Hardness of water is spoken of as being temporary or
permanent. If the water remains hard after having been
boiled it is known as permanently hard water. Hardness of
water is due to the presence of the soluble salts of the alkaline
earth metals, especially calcium and magnesium. Temporary
hardness is due to calcium or magnesium carbonate held in
solution as a bicarbonate by the dissolved carbon dioxide.
The hardness is temporary because the carbon dioxide is
driven off by boiling, and the soluble bicarbonates are precipitated
as insoluble carbonates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span></p>

<p>Permanent hardness, on the other hand, is due mainly
to sulphates and chlorides of calcium or magnesium. These
salts are stable and therefore are not precipitated by boiling.</p>


<h3>Elimination of Water from Body</h3>

<p>Water is excreted from the body through the various
channels. The kidneys excrete about 50%, the lungs about
20%, the skin about 28%, while the other 2% is excreted
through the feces and other minor channels.</p>


<h3>Amount of Water Needed for All Purposes</h3>

<p>The amount of water needed for all purposes varies just
the same as the amount of water needed by the body varies
with conditioning factors. The locality and the climate will
enter into the consideration of the amount of water needed
to meet the requirements of hygiene and sanitation.</p>

<p>The amount of water required by the human body in
twenty-four hours varies with many factors. The age of the
individual and his occupation and health, and climate would
be conditioning factors. However, authorities are pretty well
agreed as to the amount necessary. It is estimated that the
body requires a little less than one gallon of water per day,
about two quarts taken as drinking water and the balance in
food.</p>

<p>There is a wide range of difference in the amounts estimated,
for under some conditions, a minimum of seventeen
gallons, or even twelve gallons, would be sufficient, while
under other circumstances and in other localities as much as
300 gallons per day per individual would not be an excessive
or wasteful amount. The average amount estimated per individual
per day for domestic purposes is placed at seventeen
gallons for all purposes. In 1918 the statistics showed that
Buffalo used an average of 260 gallons per capita per day,
but many cities used much less. In Berlin in 1913 the water<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
consumption amounted to an average of twenty-four gallons
per capita per day.</p>

<p>The hygienic importance of these figures is insignificant
since they are only approximate. There are a number of
factors that are not taken into consideration. The figures are
estimated on the number of gallons of water pumped and no
account whatsoever is taken of the water waste through
precipitation and loss through leaky pipes. Some engineers
maintain that fully half the water pumped is lost in these
various ways. Another thing that must be considered when
comparing the amount of water used by different cities is the
industries. Some industries require much more water than
others, therefore, if a just comparison is to be made between
cities only the water that is actually passed through the private
meters must be considered.</p>


<h3>Water Waste</h3>

<p>Consideration of the subject of water would not be complete
without some reference to the amount of water that is
wasted. It seems a small matter to waste water. We sometimes
say there is plenty in the river. But the proposition of
preparing the water for use and getting it to the individual
for consumption may involve many phases of hygiene from
several different angles and one of these angles may be industrial
hygiene. To get water into the home and factory
requires a great many processes such as laying and maintaining
water mains, purifying the water and pumping. This
involves several industries and trades, so the problem of a
water supply is far reaching and is of vital importance to the
community.</p>

<p>There should never be a sacrifice on the part of hygiene
and cleanliness for the purpose of saving water. A sufficient
amount of water should at all times be insisted upon, but
certainly there should be a strenuous effort to eliminate undue
waste.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span></p>

<p>The main causes of water waste will be found to be leakage
in mains and service pipes and waste from defective fixtures
in the house. All of this leakage and waste should be properly
attended to because of the direct relation which it bears to
hygiene and particularly to industrial hygiene.</p>

<p>The introduction of meters has been an important factor
in reducing water waste. It is not the thought to limit the
amount of water used or to deprive one of a sufficient amount,
but there is nothing to be gained by an unnecessary waste.
The introduction of meters in Milwaukee reduced the amount
of water used per tap from 1,781 gallons per day to 644 gallons
per day without putting any restrictions upon the consumers.
It is an enormous task to provide a sufficient amount
of pure clean water for a large city and certainly an effort
should be made to avoid waste.</p>


<h2>SOURCES OF WATER SUPPLY</h2>


<h3>Rain Water</h3>

<p>The sources of our water supply may be classified as:
Rain and snow water, surface water and ground or subsoil
water.</p>

<p>The rain and snow water provide a supply for domestic
purposes. This source cannot be relied upon in some sections
of the country because of the variable amount of rain fall.
Rain water is pure from the fact that it has been vaporized
and then condensed the same as in distillation; but it does not
remain long in this pure state since it is exposed to so many
sources of pollution. This water is collected in receptacles
called cisterns and tanks and used mostly for household purposes.
It can readily be seen that water thus stored might
become polluted from the surfaces with which it comes in
contact. To prevent this special care would be necessary,
and in the majority of cases the need for this precaution is
not recognized.</p>

<p>This source of water supply is not very desirable since its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
quantity is variable and also because of the difficulty in storing
large quantities and in providing protection so that it will
not become contaminated and thereby rendered unfit for
household use.</p>

<p>While rain water in its unpolluted state is a pure water,
it is not suitable for drinking purposes until it is properly
aerated. The air contains dust and other suspended impurities
which will be precipitated with the rain and thus pollute the
water. However, the amount of pollution is so small that
it is of little sanitary importance. After the air has been
cleared of these suspended impurities the rain water will be
relatively pure. It will be noticed that after a rain the air
seems clear and clean; this is due to the rain actually washing
the air.</p>

<p>It is necessary to filter rain water collected from the surface
of roofs because roofs collect impurities from smoke and
dust. The average filter used for this purpose is usually
inadequate and receives such little care that it is of slight
value.</p>

<p>In the large cities or even in the larger towns the cisterns
have been replaced with more modern and more satisfactory
means of water supply. Rain water is soft and therefore is
most desirable for laundry purposes and is also very desirable
for cooking. It is not considered as satisfactory for drinking,
however, as ground water or properly filtered surface water.
It always contains gases such as nitrogen, oxygen, and carbon
dioxide. The amount of solids varies. The storage of water
in cisterns forms a good breeding place for a certain kind of
mosquito, stegomyia calopus, which is supposed to cause
yellow fever; but regardless of the supposed pathogenicity
of this mosquito it is quite objectionable.</p>


<h3>Surface Water</h3>

<p>Surface water is derived from ponds, lakes, rivers and
creeks; in fact, any water which is in contact with the atmosphere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
is known as surface water. Surface water forms really
the most desirable and satisfactory source of public water
supply.</p>

<p><b>Streams</b> form natural sewers for the regions which they
drain and ponds and lakes form convenient dumping places
for the sewage carried by the streams, therefore it will readily
be seen that the surface water is liable to great pollution from
these sources. It therefore becomes necessary to purify it by
some means before it can be used for domestic purposes.</p>

<p>At one time it was thought that streams purified themselves
in their flow, but this is now disputed and has been proven
to be erroneous and should be strenuously denied. There are
many factors at work in Nature which purify water in its
natural state. Before civilization brought about so many
artificial and unnatural conditions it was true that, with the
small amount of waste material emptied into the streams,
Nature would, through her natural processes, keep the waters
of the streams in a state of natural purity. But in the present
day with not only the sewage of our large cities pouring into
the rivers and lake, but also the waste material from factories
and different industries, it becomes necessary to use some
artificial methods for water purification.</p>

<p><b>Lakes</b>, from a sanitary standpoint, form a more desirable
source of public water supply than rivers. There are several
reasons for this. First: there is possible a greater dilution
of the impurities that reach the lake. Second: there is greater
opportunity for sedimentation which is a very important
process in water purification. Third: the water is softer than
river water and freer from organic impurities.</p>

<p>The greatest problem that a city getting its water supply
from a lake has to solve is how to keep its sewage from polluting
its own water supply. To prevent this, it is necessary
to place the intake for the water supply far out in the lake.
The danger from pollution has become so great in some places,
as in Chicago, that special canals have been constructed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
carry the sewage into other channels rather than empty it into
the lake.</p>

<p>The impurities from the sewage may travel a great distance
into the lakes. Serious sewage pollution was found ten
miles out in the lake from the mouth of the Detroit River.
Pollution has been found as far as eighteen miles from the
shore in some places.</p>

<p>So it is readily observed that, notwithstanding the fact
that the lakes and ponds furnish a more desirable public water
supply, yet this source is not, by any means, free from objections.</p>

<p>The <b>impounding reservoir</b>, which is an artificial reservoir
for the purpose of storing up water, is another very reliable
source of public water supply. These reservoirs are often
built in the mountains by placing a dam across a ravine or
canyon. The largest dam in the world is the New Croton
across the Esopus Creek in the Catskill mountains in New
York. It is 248 feet high, 185 feet thick at the bottom and
eleven feet thick at the top. This impounding reservoir
furnishes an addition to the water supply of New York
City.</p>

<p>There are many advantages to the impounding reservoirs,
but there are also many disadvantages. One advantage is
that the area drained is comparatively small and therefore the
pollution from that source is lessened; also the storage factor
which is experienced in this reservoir is an advantage. In
this way many of the so-called pathogenic microörganisms die
before they are carried to the consumer. A disadvantage is
that they are open to the atmosphere and light and this is
conducive to stagnation because the water is still. This results
in an increase in the growth of algæ and other microscopic
organisms. The stagnation of the water results in an increase
of the products of decomposition. This, together with the
microörganisms and algæ, produce the foul smell and bad
taste of the water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span></p>

<p>The stagnation of impounding reservoirs and small lakes
may become a vital factor from a hygienic standpoint. If the
water is less than twenty feet deep it will be kept in motion
by the wind and in this way will not become stagnant, but
if it is more than twenty feet deep the lower portion will remain
still. This prevents the water from mixing and therefore
the under portion will become stagnant while the surface will
not. If the water supply is taken near the surface there will
not be so much danger from the stagnant water, but even then
there are times of the year when there is a complete stirring
up of the water. This mixing of the surface water and the
bottom water takes place twice a year, in the spring and in
the fall. This mixing is the result of the changing of the temperature
of the surface water. During the summer the surface
water becomes warm and the temperature may reach
80° F. In this way the warm water remains on top but is
kept stirred up by the wind. The wind will not usually create
a disturbance for more than twenty feet except in very large
lakes where it may be as great as forty feet.</p>

<p>As winter approaches the water cools until finally the temperature
of the surface water becomes the same or more nearly
the same as the bottom water. Then the wind exerts a deeper
influence and the surface and deep water will mix. During
this process vertical currents may be produced. This mixing
continues until all the water has been thoroughly mixed and
until the temperature of the surface water goes below the
point of maximum density which occurs at 4° C. The cold
water accumulates on the surface where ice is often formed.
In the spring the process is just reversed. The fall mixing of
the water is much more thorough and intense than the spring
mixing.</p>

<p>The changes brought by this mixing are obvious. The
surface water contains a large amount of oxygen. The bottom
water contains much less oxygen but a great quantity of
decomposed products. The oxygen is carried to the bottom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
and there oxidizes and neutralizes some of the products of
decomposition.</p>

<p>The <b>sources of impurities</b> in surface water are various.
One of the most menacing sources is from the sewage which
is carried from the centers of population. In the rivers it is
the sewage of the towns and cities situated above. In the
lakes it is usually the sewage of the city itself that is likely
to pollute its own water supply. Under the present conditions
it seems that it is easier to purify the water supply
than to purify the sewage or provide some other method for
its disposal.</p>

<p>Naturally the water of rivers is purest near the source.
The reason for this is that the rivers form a natural drainage
for the land through which they flow. The waste products
from every process carried on in that territory find their way
into the streams as a natural result of the law of gravity.
The water will be found to contain large amounts of mineral
and organic matter after passing through populated and cultivated
areas. Purification of rivers is considered under Water
Purification.</p>


<h3>Ground or Subsoil Water</h3>

<p>In the consideration of the three sources of water supply
it is difficult to draw definite lines of demarcation since the
rain and snow water soon becomes surface water and the surface
water may percolate through the ground and become subsoil
water.</p>

<p><b>Well water and spring water are classed</b> as ground or subsoil
water. From a hygienic standpoint water obtained from
wells or springs forms a very reliable and satisfactory source
of supply.</p>

<p>Especially is well or spring water desirable for private
domestic use, since it is usually in a reasonable degree of
purity and does not, therefore, require any artificial process
for purification. The sources of water supply used for public<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
purposes, made necessary because of the volume of water
required, are not so satisfactory for a private or domestic
supply because its purification would entail too great an expense
to warrant the practicability on such a small scale.
Therefore, the most desirable source when only a limited
amount of water is required is the wells.</p>

<p>Wells may be used for public water supply and are in some
of the smaller towns, but they are not so practicable as their
supply is likely to be inconstant. In other words, there is
danger of the wells going dry, and since they are put down
at a great expense, this would be too great a risk to take even
though the water thus obtained is satisfactory from a hygienic
standpoint.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="image119" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image119.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>The above illustration shows the fluctuation of ground water. When the
ground water is at the low mark the shallow well becomes dry; as the
water rises it flows into the well. When the water has reached the high
mark the intermittent spring becomes a flowing spring. The pressure of
the ground water is great enough to produce flowing wells down on the level.</p>
</div>
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Not all wells, by any means, will furnish a pure water
supply. There are many factors to consider from the viewpoint
of the pollution of well water and these will be considered
in due time. When water reaches an impervious strata
it remains at that level and moves in a horizontal plane.
Water may form in beds or be found in underground streams.
It is only in the limestone regions that water forms in streams
under the ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="image120" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image120.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">Poorly constructed well, polluted by seepage thru limestone.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span></p>

<p>The depth at which water is found beneath the surface
varies. The water directly beneath the surface, or that which
is derived from surface drainage and the rainfall, is, by some,
styled the ground water. This is the shallow water. That
which is found at a lower level is called the lower subsoil
water or underground water.</p>

<p>The ground water does not provide a very desirable source
of well water because there is danger of pollution from the
surface. The degree of this impurity will depend largely upon
the character of the soil. If it is sandy and thus provides a
good filter medium there is little danger from pollution; but
if the soil is of a limestone formation it makes a very poor
filter and the shallow water is likely to be polluted from the
surface drainage.</p>

<p>The subsoil water moves in the direction of the nearest
body of water. That is, if it is near a river or lake its
movement will be in the direction of this river or lake.
For this reason a well near the seashore will contain fresh
water.</p>

<p>In wells less than fifty feet deep the temperature of the
water will be influenced by that of the atmosphere. It will
be warmer in summer and cooler in winter. Some authors
put this depth at much less than fifty feet, maintaining that
the atmospheric temperature will have no influence whatsoever
at such a depth. It is true, however, and the fact is undisputed,
that in wells 50 feet deep or more the water is cool
and the temperature remains constant. It is not influenced
by the change in atmospheric temperature.</p>

<p>Sand and gravel deposits form the best source through
which to obtain subsoil water. To supply any very great
amount there must be a number of wells and these must be
far enough apart so as not to draw from the same territory.
Seventy-eight million gallons of subsoil water per day is provided
at Brooklyn from twenty-four separate pumping stations.
Memphis, Tennessee, is the largest city in the United States
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>which gets its entire water supply from sand and gravel
deposits.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="image122" style="max-width: 61.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image122.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">Poorly constructed well, polluted by surface drainage.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Sandstone rock furnishes an excellent source for subsoil
water since it makes an excellent filter. Because of the limited
amount of water obtained in a sandstone formation this source
is practicable only for a very limited supply.</p>

<p>Limestone formation is the most undesirable source of
subsoil water supply from a hygienic standpoint. Limestone
is not porous and therefore has no filtering qualities. If water
does pass through this sort of a formation it must travel
through its crevices and fissures.</p>

<p>It is very difficult to know where the pollution of water
passing through limestone originates. As these fissures are
usually very long, and as the water is in no way filtered as
it passes through them, the contamination might enter the
water at a point far distant from where the well is sunk. The
water supply from limestone is likely to be inconstant because
the water is not contained in the limestone, but flows through
the cracks and crevices. In this way it may soon flow away
unless the source is replenished by rain or snow.</p>

<p>Water from the subsoil is obtained, as has been stated,
from wells. Wells are classified as shallow and deep. By a
shallow well is commonly meant one that is dug and not
more than thirty feet deep. This type is usually walled up
with brick or stone and is from five to six feet in diameter.
Shallow wells may also be driven. That is, a gaspipe with a
sand point is driven into the ground until the water-table is
reached, the water being pumped out with an ordinary suction
pump.</p>

<p>Shallow wells must never be considered a satisfactory
source of water supply where there are conditions existing
which would result in such pollution of the ground that the
water percolating through can not be more or less filtered.
Sewage polluted soil never is satisfactory for shallow wells.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="image124" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image124.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">Showing a properly constructed well in unsanitary locations.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Deep wells are drilled and are from six to eight inches in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>diameter. The water from deep wells may be free from contamination
but may contain a great deal of mineral in solution
and different salts which render it permanently or
temporarily hard. This decreases its value from a sanitary
viewpoint and more particularly from an economic standpoint.</p>

<p>Special attention should be given the construction of the
well. The casing or walls should be as tight as possible.
Special care should be exercised against the possibility of
surface water percolating through the casing as this drainage
will bring impurities.</p>

<p>The casing should project far enough above the surface
of the ground to insure against water running from the surface.
It should extend at least eighteen inches above the
ground. The well should have a tight covering.</p>

<p>The ground possesses great filtering qualities and therefore
great quantities of impurities will be taken from the
water as it filters through. The danger is when the ground
becomes so filled with impurities that its filtering qualities
have been destroyed or when there is not sufficient distance
between the source of pollution and the water level; also
when the soil is of a limestone formation and the water, instead
of percolating through it, passes through cracks and crevices,
in which event it will in no sense be filtered.</p>

<p>It was at one time considered that wells should be ventilated
and a great deal of stress was laid upon it. When it is
taken into consideration that the water under ground is in no
way ventilated except through the natural means, it will
readily be understood that it is not necessary to provide ventilation
merely because the water has been tapped by a well.</p>

<p>If the origin of pollution, such as cesspools, is too near
the well or the well is too shallow, not allowing enough distance
for purification, there will be great danger from such
sources. The greatest danger is in the shallow wells. However,
these are entirely satisfactory as a source of domestic
supply, providing the soil is of a sandy or gravel formation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
and there are no barnyard or cesspools, for example, too near
the wells. A shallow well in a limestone region is not satisfactory
and should be discarded when at all possible. If it
is necessary to use such, every precaution possible should be
taken to eliminate the possibility of contamination.</p>


<h2>METHODS OF PURIFICATION</h2>


<h3>Natural Methods of Water Purification</h3>

<p>In considering the subject of water purification it is not
our thought to go into detail and explain the processes that
are necessary to accomplish a pure water supply, but to deal
with the subject in a general way that we may appreciate
what is necessary in this line.</p>

<p>We will first take note of the methods used by Nature in
purifying water. Nature’s method of obtaining chemically
pure water is by evaporation and condensation. The result
of this method is the snow and rain water. About three-fourths
of the earth’s surface is covered with water. The
sun acts as a great furnace and the atmosphere as a vast
still. In this way we see that a great quantity of water is
distilled and returned to the earth in a state of purity. It is
estimated by Summerville that “186,240 cubic miles of water
are annually raised from the surface of the globe in the form
of vapor chiefly in the intertropical seas.”</p>

<p>It is entirely erroneous to assume that the impurities in
water are eliminated by freezing. Ice may contain great
quantities of impurities, even so-called pathogenic germs. It
has been shown that many germs are not destroyed by freezing.
It is true, however, that ice will be purer than the water
from which it is taken.</p>

<p>There are certain processes which result in a purifying influence
as water is crystallized. As ice forms it excludes suspended
matter and even under certain conditions will exclude
dissolved substances. It will thus be seen that even though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
ice may not be pure, the danger from its use is greatly reduced.
It is not advisable to use water from melted ice for
drinking purposes.</p>

<p>Manufactured ice is supposed to be free from impurities,
but this is not necessarily true. If ice is produced artificially
from distilled or properly filtered water it will naturally be
pure, provided it does not become polluted in the process of
manufacture.</p>

<p>At one time it was believed that river water would become
pure in a flow of seven miles. This, however, could not be
true since the distance of the flow is of less importance than
the time required for the flow.</p>

<p>The greatest aid in this method of water purification comes
from the impurities mixing with the volume of water as it
flows. The impurities become diluted and if sufficient time
elapses the bacteria and microörganisms will die a natural
death.</p>

<p>The principal process involved in self-purification of water
is the oxidation of nitrogenous organic matter which is a
chemical process. In the course of time the microörganisms
die as a result of the biological action. Then there is the
effect of dilution, sedimentation, especially in lakes and still
water, and the effect of sunlight.</p>

<p>Food for the bacteria is lessened as a result of the destruction
of the organic matter through oxidation. The minute
infusoria, amœbæ and water worms feed upon organic matter
and bacteria and thus aid in the process of purification. The
plants known as algæ play a very important part also in
water purification. They take up the organic substances and
perform other functions similar to the vegetation on the land.
The purifying effects of water vegetation is very important.</p>

<p>One of the chief sanitary safeguards in Nature is dilution.
A small amount of pollution may be quickly diluted by a
volume of water until it is practically harmless. In its concentrated
state, however, there might be enough poison, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
strength of which would be greater than the internal resistance
of the individual. This would produce toxic conditions, or
it might even be great enough to produce subluxations.</p>

<p><b>Sedimentation</b> is another of Nature’s methods that is of
great value. This process has been aped by man in the coagulation
produced by the use of chemicals. This action is largely
mechanical. During the process of sedimentation it is only
the suspended matter that settles; but it is maintained that
the bacteria and microörganisms become entangled and are
carried to the bottom and in this way the water is freed from
more than simply the mechanical impurities. If allowed to remain
in storage a sufficient time, the harmful bacteria will
die a natural death. There are processes, however, that take
place during the time of storage which are objectionable, but
these relate more to the taste or smell of the water than to the
production of harmful ingredients.</p>

<p>During sedimentation there is a natural settling of the
suspended particles. Not only is the desired result obtained
in freezing the water of solids, but as the suspended matter
sinks to the bottom many of the bacteria will also be carried
down. Sedimentation, however, is not a method that can be
used promiscuously. It is usually employed in connection
with some other method; with a slow sand filter, for example,
or when mechanical filtration is used.</p>

<p>Sunlight is Nature’s greatest germicide. Direct sunlight
destroys germ life and renders much aid in maintaining sanitary
environmental conditions. It has a purifying effect upon
water in this way. When the water is in motion or during
times of turbidity great good is accomplished from a sanitary
standpoint by the direct rays of the sun.</p>


<h3>Artificial Methods of Water Purification</h3>

<p>The only way to obtain chemically pure water is by distillation.
However, since this method is very slow and expensive,
it is not at all practicable for the purification of even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
a private water supply, and since a chemically pure water is
not required for drinking or other domestic purposes it would
be entirely unnecessary to provide it. Again, distilled water
is not desirable for drinking purposes since its taste is insipid
until it is aerated.</p>

<p>When only a small amount of water is required it may be
freed of organic poisonous substances by boiling. This will
not, however, render water that contains lead and other stable

<p>The dissolved gases are given off by boiling and this leaves
the water with a flat taste which may be improved by aerating;
this may be done by stirring or by placing the water in a jar
and shaking it.</p>

<p><b>Filtration</b> is by far the most practicable method of water
purification. There are many different methods used. The
two most used are known as the natural and mechanical.</p>

<p>Under what is known as the natural methods, the sand
filter seems to have precedent. The efficiency of this filter
depends upon the material used, the velocity of the water<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
through the filter and the care, such as proper cleaning which
the filter receives.</p>

<p>As a matter of information the student should become
somewhat familiar with the general construction of a sand
filter. The size of the filter, that is, the area it covers, will
be governed by the amount of water to be filtered per day,
which in turn will depend upon the demands. The greatest
objection to a slow sand filter is that a very large tract of
land is required to provide sufficient surface for the percolation
of the water.</p>

<p>The bottom and sides of the filter-beds are water-tight
and are constructed of cement with proper drains to carry
off the filtered water. A layer of very coarse gravel is placed
on the bottom of the filter, then on top of this is a layer of
fine gravel. This is then covered with fine sharp sand about
three feet deep. Ordinarily the entire filter medium is from
four to six feet deep.</p>

<p>On top of this layer of fine sand a thin scum is formed
which increases the efficiency of the filter, its action being
biological. As this scum accumulates it becomes necessary
to remove it. This is done by special devices. It is necessary
to remove only a small portion of the sand, for it will be clean
immediately below the surface. This process is continued
until the layer of sand has decreased in depth to about twelve
inches when it is replenished with new, or with polluted sand
which has been removed and thoroughly washed with filtered
water.</p>

<p>The filter is first filled by admitting water from beneath
for the purpose of forcing the air out. The depth of water is
kept about three feet above the sand.</p>

<p>The rate of filtration is controlled and kept at a velocity
of about two inches per hour. At this rate a filter of one
acre area will provide about 3,000,000 gallons per day.</p>

<p>A first class slow sand filter should free the water of 99%
of the bacteria. Hygienists claim that filtered water should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
not contain more than 100 bacteria to a cubic centimeter.
Water from a new filter or one that has just been cleaned
should be tested before it is used. By this method one can
determine whether the desired results are being obtained.</p>

<p>It may be necessary to store the water in reservoirs before
it is passed through the sand filter for the purpose of sedimentation.
This will rid the water of the small particles of
sediment which is contained in the turbid water. If turbid
water is passed through a sand filter the smallest particles
will pass on through with it. This causes a tendency to fill
the filter with clay and other substances.</p>

<p>Instead of the water passing slowly through the sand, it
is forced through in mechanical filtration. The sand is contained
in cylinders or tanks and the water is forced through
either as the result of gravity and weight of the water above
or by mechanical means. Before it is passed through the sand
in the mechanical filter, it is treated chemically to coagulate
and precipitate the suspended impurities. This process is not
only mechanical in the sense that it is accomplished by means
of certain machinery, but the action on the water is mechanical.
There is no bacteriological action which is so essential
as this mechanical action in the process of water purification.</p>

<p>The mechanical method of water filtration has not been
found to be as satisfactory as the slow sand filter process,
although very large amounts of water may be filtered in much
less time. One great disadvantage of this method is that the
filters require such frequent cleaning and in this respect are
very expensive to maintain.</p>

<p><b>Chemical purification</b> is not considered by some hygienists
as a satisfactory method for purifying large water supplies.
There are many objections to this method. Even though the
water is freed from the impurities it has received in its natural
course, it is laden with chemicals that may be as injurious
to health as the impurities themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span></p>

<p>The chemicals used are: Chlorine, bromine, copper sulphate,
metallic iron, ozone and sodium bisulphate.</p>


<h3>Swimming Pools</h3>

<p>In connection with the subject of water a word relative to
the sanitation of swimming pools will not be out of place.
There are many municipal swimming pools in operation and
while they are intended to improve the sanitary conditions,
they may at the same time become a great menace to hygiene
if they are not properly conducted.</p>

<p>No individual should be allowed to enter a swimming pool
without first having taken a shower bath with a liberal use
of soap. No one should be allowed in the pool who is infected
with skin dis-eases of any kind, ulcers, running sores, conjunctivitis,
or venereal dis-eases.</p>

<p>The water should be properly filtered when it enters the
pool and there should be a constant process of disinfection.
There should be not only right construction, but also fit maintenance
of the pool. The swimmer should be properly instructed
relative to swimming pool sanitation.</p>


<h2>SEWAGE AND REFUSE DISPOSAL</h2>


<h3>Methods of Sewage Disposal</h3>

<p>One of the greatest problems the hygienists and sanitary
engineers have to solve is the disposal of sewage and refuse
without contaminating the water supply and in other ways
rendering the environment unhealthful.</p>

<p>The methods used for the immediate removal of sewage
may be either the dry method or the water method. By far
the more common one in towns and cities is the water carriage
system. In small towns, however, the more prevalent
way is to provide a house some distance from the dwelling
which contains a privy vault.</p>

<p>Where sewage is removed by the water method and carried
through sewers to the waterways, such as rivers and lakes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
the great problem which the sanitary engineers have to solve
is how to dispose of the sewage and not pollute the water
supply of the city.</p>

<p>When there is a sufficient amount of water to insure proper
dilution sewage may be emptied directly into it without treatment.
But where there is a limited amount of water, as in
a small stream, and a very large amount of sewage to be
disposed of, the water may become overloaded and thus the
supply of other towns become polluted. When sewage is disposed
of in the ocean, oyster beds may become contaminated
as well as the bathing beaches.</p>


<h3>Sewage Purification</h3>

<p>It is considered cheaper and at the same time satisfactory
from a hygienic standpoint to depend more upon proper filtration
than upon any other method of purification.</p>

<p>There are many different methods used for sewage purification.
Sewage may be screened. This frees it from the larger
particles. It is then placed in tanks and by a slow process of
sedimentation relieved of a large amount of the suspended
matter that passes through the screens. After these processes
it may then be carried to fields for subsurface irrigation. It is
carried through porous tile pipes ten to eighteen inches below
the surface and two feet to three feet apart. In this way the
sewage seeps through into a sandy soil. An acre will take
care of the sewage from 150 to 250 people a day. This method
can not be used at all in clay soil.</p>

<p>The crude sewage may be applied to the surface of the
land and carried by means of ditches, but this is not considered
satisfactory. Sand filters are also used, but they
require frequent cleaning and renewing.</p>

<p>According to Price the most desirable method of sewage
disposal is known as the septic method. In this method the
sewage is sorted and the action that follows is bacteriological.
The bacteria present act in the absence of air or oxygen. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
sewage thus undergoes a process of decomposition, fermentation
and purification.</p>

<p>The next step is to pass the sewage that has come from
the septic tank through open sand filters very slowly. These
sand filters must be properly cleaned and renewed at regular
intervals and must at no time be overloaded. This makes the
effluent from the filter beds entirely free from germs and
harmful matter. It is not necessary for us to consider the
construction of these septic tanks. There are any number of
different types, but the results are supposed to be the same.
The construction of such tanks is in the province of sanitary
engineering and not in that of practical hygiene.</p>

<p>Price states that the water which comes from the filter
beds after the sewage has first been through the septic tank
is free from injurious substances, is capable of supporting life
and that even the drinking of it has been known not to be
followed by injurious results.</p>


<h3>Refuse Disposal</h3>

<p>Another great problem is the disposal of refuse such as
ashes, garbage, and in the larger cities, street sweepings. It is
estimated by Whipple that in the larger cities like New York
the refuse will be in round numbers a ton per capita per year.
This is an enormous amount of material and the disposal of it
becomes a great problem. This is not only of hygienic importance,
but also one of economical significance.</p>

<p>The collection of waste material is objectionable from the
social viewpoint; also an accumulation of ashes and dust will
irritate the eyes and respiratory tract, while piles of garbage
and other filth are conducive to the breeding of flies and mosquitoes.
Such collections result also in the development of
ill-smelling odors and unsightly streets and alleys.</p>

<p>There are different methods used to dispose of this waste
material. It may be collected and burned. This method is
called incineration. Or the refuse may be collected separately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
and disposed of. When it is to be disposed of separately there
are usually city ordinances which require the householder to
keep the garbage and ashes separate and they are then collected
by the city in separate wagons. In most cities tall
garbage cans are required and the garbage is drained and
wrapped in paper, the ashes are placed in cans or containers.
They are used for filling in low lands while the garbage is
taken away and buried or burned.</p>

<p>For the collection of garbage specially constructed wagons
or carts are used. The garbage must be collected frequently
and at regular intervals before it becomes decomposed and
gives off objectionable odors. The wagons must be properly
cleaned for the same reason. In the removal of ashes and
other refuse, care should be taken not to create a dust
and the wagons should not leak so as to litter the streets
and alleys.</p>

<p class="center no-indent fs120 bold">SCHOOL HYGIENE</p>

<h2>SCHOOL BUILDING</h2>


<h3>Site</h3>

<p>In the consideration of school hygiene we will first briefly
discuss the school building. Its site should be carefully
chosen. It should be reasonably high; the soil should be
porous, if possible, and properly drained to insure dryness.
The building should not be located near a manufacturing
plant or other places where there is much noise, smoke, gases
or fumes. The buildings should be plain but artistic, and
should by all means be modern, fireproof, substantial and
sanitary.</p>

<p>The building should be surrounded by sufficient yard room
to provide ample playground. There should be plenty of
shade but not so many trees that there will be an interference
with the sunlight and ventilation of the grounds. Some attention
should be given the beautifying of the yards, for it must
be remembered that the entire child goes to school—physical,
mental and spiritual natures must all be developed.</p>

<p>The number of stories a modern school building should
have is somewhat of a mooted question; however, it is quite
obvious that there are many objections to a building of more
than two stories. A two-story building certainly is an advantage
and especially is this true when the pupils have to change
for their different classrooms.</p>


<h3>Stairways</h3>

<p>Stairways should be of ample width, allowing pupils to
pass up and down without danger of crowding. The risers
should be no more than six inches and the treads not more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
than twelve inches. Where the pupils are compelled to go
from one floor to another several times a day it is much better
to have inclines instead of stairs.</p>


<h3>Corridors</h3>

<p>The corridors should be wide enough so that the children
in passing and repassing will not have to crowd. They should
be at least ten feet in width and should be supplied with
plenty of doors for exits, ventilation and light and also windows
for ventilation and light. When practicable the corridors
should be along the north side. This insures sufficient lighting
and at the same time does not interfere with the lighting
and ventilating of the schoolroom. It is more important that
the direct rays of the sun be admitted to the schoolroom than
to the corridors.</p>


<h3>Basement</h3>

<p>The basement should be well protected from dampness;
therefore it should be well ventilated and properly heated, as
well as arranged so that the direct rays of the sun may reach
at least a part of it.</p>

<p>The basement should not be used for classrooms unless it
is for machine shops, or workrooms. It should not be used
for playgrounds or gymnasium, but may be used for bathrooms
and toilets. It should occupy the entire space under
the building.</p>


<h3>The Schoolroom</h3>

<p>In planning the building it must be remembered that the
schoolroom is the unit of the building and therefore must
receive primary consideration. The entire building should
be a collection of schoolrooms properly arranged.</p>

<p>The schoolroom should be about twenty-five feet by thirty
feet with not less than a thirteen foot ceiling; this size room
will be large enough for thirty pupils and no teacher should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
be required to take care of more than this number in a class.
There should be plenty of entrance and exit doors for each
room.</p>

<p>The interior of the classroom should be attractive but
plain, the surfaces smooth, the junctions of ceiling and floor
with walls should be concave. All mouldings, projections,
ledges where dust and dirt could lodge should be eliminated.
The walls should be of such a color as to absorb as little light
as possible and prove least taxing to the eyes. A light green-gray
is favored. The walls must be so treated with paint or
some other method employed so as to be readily washed or
otherwise cleaned. White ceilings which reflect the light are
best. Floors are made of hard wood in narrow planks with
matched joints, or they are dovetailed. This may be laid over
false floors of boards or reinforced concrete. The walls, floors,
ceilings and partitions must be proof against sound, dampness,
fire, vermin, and dust.</p>


<h3>Lighting</h3>

<p>The lighting of the schoolroom, the amount of glass surface
or window area, will be governed by the aspect, the location
of the building, direction from which the light is admitted,
shape of the room and the proximity of other buildings or
objects which might obstruct the light. The window area
must be ample to insure sufficient light in every part of the
room even on dark, overcast and cloudy days. The rule is that
the window area should be at least one-fourth of the floor
space and it is practically impossible to have an excessive
window area for the light may be toned down and softened
by shades and awnings. Prism glass is more practicable because
it refracts the light and gives a more even distribution
over the entire room.</p>

<p>Most of the light should be admitted over the left shoulder
of the pupil so as to eliminate annoying shadows, but it is not
necessary that all the light come from the left. The windows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
should reach to the ceiling and the height of the sill from the
floor should be about four feet. Light should never enter
from the front and strike the eyes of the pupil. The upper
fourth of the window furnishes one-third of the light, also
the best light; therefore it can readily be seen that window
shades should not be hung from the top but from the bottom,
and should be rolled upward. In nature the light comes
from above, hence this being natural it is consequently
best.</p>


<h3>Ventilation</h3>

<p>Pure air is absolutely indispensable for mental work. Much
time and energy is wasted by teacher and pupil in trying to
work in vitiated atmosphere. The educational results obtained
in the school will be influenced more than has been conceded
by the character of the air the pupil and teacher are forced
to breathe. Vitiated air will produce sluggishness, headache,
listlessness, inattention, lack of energy and a depression of
mental vigor which will prevent the child from doing his best
work. The same influence will be felt by the teacher and the
result will be inefficiency in instruction.</p>

<p>Natural means of ventilation should not be relied upon
since it is difficult to get a sufficient amount of fresh air into
the rooms in winter time without creating objectionable drafts
which interfere with heating. Regardless of the method employed
in ventilating it is a good plan to open all of the
doors and windows occasionally during the day and flush
the rooms with fresh air. At such time the children should
exercise or employ some means to prevent them from taking
cold.</p>

<p>Schoolhouses should be provided with the combined plenum
and vacuum system and operated in conjunction with the heating
plant in cold weather. In this way the air that is admitted
can be regulated not only as to quantity, but also the velocity
can be controlled and likewise the humidity and temperature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span></p>


<h3>Heating</h3>

<p>The relation between ventilating and heating must be kept
in mind. It is not only a question of providing a proper
amount of pure air, but also a question of the proper temperature
of the air. A poorly ventilated room is always more
difficult to heat and an improperly heated room is very difficult
to ventilate. Local heating should never be used in a
schoolroom except when impossible to provide better means.</p>

<p>The best arrangement for heating school buildings is hot
water or steam in connection with the ventilating system in
which the air is passed over hot radiators before being forced
into the classrooms and corridors. This is supplemented by
heat from the radiators placed in proper locations throughout
the building. In this way the temperature of the room may
be kept at the proper degree and at the same time the air
circulation and the humidity properly regulated. Best work
is accomplished by the children when the temperature is kept
at about 68° F.</p>


<h3>School Desks</h3>

<p>The furniture most important to the health of the child
is the desk and the desk chair. These should be very carefully
adjusted to the child; if this is not properly done the
child will have a tendency to assume a faulty posture which
will favor the development of curvatures of the spine and
other physical defects.</p>

<p>The height of the desk should be such that the pupil will
not find it necessary to raise the shoulder in placing the arm
on the desk to write, or so low that he will have to bend forward.
The top should slope at an angle of about fifteen
degrees. The best distance from the eyes is from twelve to
fourteen inches.</p>

<p>The height of the chair from the floor should be very carefully
adjusted to the student and it should allow the feet to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
rest comfortably on the floor; that is, when the student is
seated the thighs should be level and the leg at right angles
to the thigh, thus allowing the feet to rest on the floor. If
the chair is too low there will be too much weight thrown on
the back of the thighs while a chair that is too high produces
too much flexion of the lumbar region of the spine. The slope
of the seat should be slightly backward and downward and
the depth about two-thirds the length of the thighs. The back
of the chair should slope slightly backward and should be
made to fit the curve of the back.</p>

<p>The chair should be placed far enough from the desk so
that the abdomen will not touch its edge. When properly
adjusted in most cases the edge of the chair will project under
the edge of the desk about one inch. In the lower grades
it is best to adjust the seats and desks to the child twice a
year.</p>


<h3>Blackboards</h3>

<p>The best material for blackboards is slate, which furnishes
a surface that is not shiny and will not reflect the light. They
can be washed and easily kept clean and thus lessen the
nuisance of dust. Blackboards should never be placed between
windows. When possible there should be no windows on the
same wall because when pupils are looking at the board
there should be no light shining in their eyes. The blackboards
are best placed opposite the principal light.</p>

<p>Dustless chalk is best and the use of colored crayons made
of arsenic or sulphide of mercury should be prohibited, since
the dust from these crayons is poisonous.</p>

<p>The blackboards should be plainly visible to all the pupils
and care should be taken that all writing or other work on
the board is large enough for the pupils to see without eye
strain. The distance of each pupil from the board should be
governed by the strength of vision.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span></p>


<h3>Charts</h3>

<p>If charts are used the printed matter should be large
enough for the pupils to read without undue strain on the eyes.
Glass surfaces should be avoided to prevent objectionable
reflections and all figures and illustrations should be plainly
visible, but objectionable bright colors and clashy combinations
should be avoided.</p>


<h3>Cloakrooms</h3>

<p>In school buildings having no lockers the pupils must place
their wraps in a cloakroom. There should be such a room for
each classroom. The cloakroom should be well ventilated,
lighted and heated and should be connected with both the
hallway and the classroom.</p>

<p>Special attention should be given the wet clothing and
provision made for drying the same. This can be nicely
taken care of during school hours by the janitor. Children
should never be allowed to sit in damp clothing during
the school hours. All dressing-rooms, cloakrooms and lockers
should be kept clean.</p>


<h3>Water Supply</h3>

<p>It is very essential that an ample supply of fresh, pure
water be provided. The old drinking cup is a thing of the
past, except possibly in some of the smaller country schools,
and it is fortunate that a more modern method has taken its
place. The supply fixtures, such as the drinking fountains,
should be conveniently located and in a part of the building
easily accessible to the pupils. A sufficient number of fountains
should be provided so there will be no necessity for
crowding. They should be placed in a well lighted and
properly heated portion of the building and special care taken
that the floor does not become damp and unsanitary. The
fixture which allows a constant bubbling of the water is most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
satisfactory, since it eliminates the necessity for the child to
operate and hence lessens the temptation for the child to play
in the water.</p>


<h3>Toilets</h3>

<p>Ample toilet facilities should be provided and separate
toilets arranged for the girls and boys. The toilets may be
placed in the basement of the school building, but special
attention must be given to their proper ventilation. They
should be kept so clean that it will not be necessary to use
deodorizers; they should be constantly and automatically
flushed. The floors should be of cement to allow thorough
washing every day and the urinals of slate or some other
hard, non-absorbent material. In the girl’s toilet the seats
of the water closets should not be too high. Where practicable
there should be a separate toilet for the little girls and stools
provided with U-shaped seats. This will assist very materially
in maintaining cleanliness. The toilets should be well ventilated
and lighted. This is of special importance and should
receive the most careful attention. A matron should be in
attendance to help care for the kindergarten children and also
those of the lower grades. The toilets at all time should be
under supervision of a competent, dependable person.</p>


<h2>PERSONAL FACTORS</h2>


<h3>Function of School Life</h3>

<p>A large part of the child’s life is spent in the schoolroom
and it must be remembered that it is that part of the child’s
life when he is most susceptible to environment and is therefore
most easily influenced mentally, morally and physically.
The entire child goes to school, therefore the function of the
school is to develop the physical and moral as well as the
mental.</p>

<p>Youth is the time of unrest and intense activity and the
schoolwork should be so arranged that the energies of childhood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
and youth may be directed so as to develop the pupil
into a symmetrical adult. With such intense activity a great
amount of energy is used up; thus it is clear that the child
needs plenty of sleep and the proper amount of good, nourishing
food and if he is deprived of these he can not do his best
work mentally.</p>


<h3>Age of Beginner</h3>

<p>We have not yet fully realized that our present school system,
well organized as it is, has certain ill effects on the
health of the children. Many of the reasons are peculiar to
the circumstance under which the child must attend school
and can not be relieved, but there are many that can be corrected
and in time will be. Children are often sent to school
at too early an age and as a result the growth is retarded and
in some cases results in an actual defective physical development.
The physical development is often retarded by prolonged
fatigue. This fatigue may be the result of improper
ventilation, forced attention to subjects that are too difficult,
strict discipline, lack of sufficient relaxation and many other
factors connected with the ordinary school.</p>

<p>One of the greatest mistakes in our modern system of
education is sending the child to school too young. Six years
of age is plenty young; seven years old is better. Even at
this age some are not sufficiently sturdy to endure the mental
and physical strain of the schoolroom and the application to
the studies that is usually exacted of them.</p>


<h3>Play Periods Necessary</h3>

<p>The school affords an environment that is entirely different
from that which the child has been accustomed to; therefore
the beginner should be allowed much liberty and should not
be compelled to remain in his seat more than one-third of
the time. This should be divided into short intervals, alternating
work and play. It must be remembered that the small<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
child is active; therefore it is imperative that he be given
various exercises that will call into play the different muscles
of his body. This will have a tendency to relieve the fatigue
from sitting at the desk. When children first start to school
they usually lose weight and become more or less nervous
during the first few days or weeks.</p>

<p>The child should be allowed sufficient free time during each
day for play and for the development of initiative. The amount
of home work required should be very carefully considered
and regulated according to the capacity and ability of the
child; yet care must be taken or the especially bright child
will be overworked and will not be given enough time for
play and the development of a real childhood.</p>


<h3>Peculiarities of Child Considered</h3>

<p>The peculiarities of the child should be considered and the
curriculum arranged accordingly. The methods of study
should receive proper consideration as well as the methods
of teaching. Special classes should be arranged for the backward
students. Many cases of backwardness or mental deficiency
are due to the child’s inability to see clearly or hear
distinctly, and when these conditions are corrected the child
will be normally bright. Many times a child is unjustly disciplined
because of some physical defect or handicap which
should be corrected.</p>

<p>Statistics show that tests and examinations have a detrimental
effect upon the health of the pupils. Experiments have
shown that children lose weight during such tests and examinations;
that they are restless at night and suffer loss of
appetite. All these have a bearing upon the health of the
child.</p>


<h3>Posture</h3>

<p>Attention should be given the habits of the children and
especially the posture of the child as he sits in the seat at his
desk. A faulty posture may result in an adaptative curvature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
of the spine which in later years will do much harm. The
sitting posture is of more importance than the standing posture
since the child sits so much more than he stands.</p>

<p>The pupil should not be allowed to sit in a stooped position
over his desk as this cramps the chest and interferes with
respiration, makes the heart action labored and produces round
shoulders; it also tends to produce a kyphosis in the dorsal
region of the spine. If a child persists in sitting in this stooped
position and finds it difficult to sit in the proper position, attention
should be given the spine, for subluxations will be found
which are interfering with the transmission of mental impulses
to the muscles of the back, thus making it difficult for
the child to sit in the normal posture. Or it may be defective
eyes which make it difficult for the child to see his work and
he therefore stoops that the work may be brought nearer the
eyes. In this case a cervical subluxation will be found and
when properly adjusted no more trouble will be experienced.
It may be this tendency to stoop is the result of fatigue; to
overcome this he should be given periods of rest and relaxation
from time to time during school hours; or this fatigue
may be due to poor elimination from the kidney place subluxations.</p>


<h3>Recess</h3>

<p>During the morning and afternoon sessions the pupils
should be given a recess for fifteen or twenty minutes, and
when the weather will permit all the children should be required
to go outdoors and engage in some form of play or
exercise, properly supervised by a thoroughly competent individual.
This will not only benefit the pupils physically,
but will also make the mind more active and aid very materially
in their mental development. In addition to this exercise,
some time during the day the windows should be opened,
except possibly in extremely cold weather, and the teacher
and pupils should engage in some form of calisthenics. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
will tend to keep the pupils in a fit physical condition and
mentally alert for the balance of the day.</p>

<p>The school grounds should be provided with modern equipment
for the proper development of the children physically
and should be supervised by kind and well trained attendants.
Every school should have a well equipped and properly supervised
gymnasium.</p>


<h3>School Dis-eases</h3>

<p>At one time the school was thought to be largely responsible
for the spread of dis-eases among children, but this idea
is changing in later years. In reality there are no specific
school dis-eases. The dis-eases that have been so referred to
are merely those abnormal conditions incident to childhood
and youth. Rosenau gives a very interesting article on this
subject. He says: “Parents naturally come to regard the
school as a veritable pesthouse for the spread of communicable
dis-eases of childhood—especially measles, whooping cough,
mumps, diphtheria, scarlet fever, common colds, etc. Many
of these dis-eases prevail in epidemic form during the summer
time, when school is closed, and under other circumstances
which show the epidemics may be independent of school
attendance. It is difficult to determine just what part is played
by the commingling of the pupils in school in the spread of
such dis-eases and what part is due to other factors. Some dis-eases
take a sudden jump in the autumn with the opening of
school. Further, these dis-eases are not contracted by the
school children alone, but are carried home to the other members
of the household, and thereby create secondary foci.
This problem of the communicable dis-eases and the school
is far from solution; the spread of these dis-eases has not been
conquered by medical inspection, and their relation to school
attendance is one that needs careful observation and study.”</p>

<p>Thus we see that the cause of school dis-eases has not been
answered, and we find in this article that which strengthens<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
the contention of Chiropractic—that the cause of the dis-ease
is in the child and not something introduced from the outside.</p>

<p>The environment of the school creates a necessity for certain
internal adaptative actions, and if this adaptative action
can not take place the result will be an abnormal condition
peculiar to the necessity for adaptation. The lack of adaptation
may result in incoördinations of the respiratory tract;
incoördinations of the eyes, involving not only the sight but
the different tissues and secretions of the eyes; incoördinations
involving the heart, throat and mouth and many conditions
of eruptions of the skin. Especially do we find deformities
and incoördinations of the spine and spinal column.</p>

<p>In diagnostic terminology these conditions would be called
bronchitis, bronchopneumonia, pleurisy, myopia, catarrhal conjunctivitis,
trachoma, cardiac dis-eases, such as endocarditis,
etc. The mouth, nose and throat dis-eases would be coryza,
adenoid growths, enlarged tonsils, tonsilitis, nose bleed, etc.
These conditions could all be prevented or corrected by adjusting
the causative subluxations.</p>


<h3>Prophylaxis</h3>

<p>It is not necessary for us to go into an explanation of the
spinal column and how subluxations are produced. It is sufficient
at this time to call the student’s attention to the fact
that subluxations are often produced, and especially is this true
during childhood. The children are subject to falls during
their play at school and they are most likely to produce
subluxations. This being true, the children should be analyzed
periodically to determine the subluxations and then they should
be adjusted. When parents realize the good that is to come
from such procedure they will take their children to the
chiropractor and have their spine palpated and the subluxations
adjusted. When this becomes a universal practice there
will be a marked decrease in the so-called school dis-eases or
children’s dis-eases.</p>

<h2>GENERAL CONSIDERATION</h2>


<h3>Definition</h3>

<p>That branch of hygiene dealing with industries is of very
great importance. This will be readily recognized when we
consider that practically the entire population is involved in
some sort of gainful occupation.</p>

<p>Industrial hygiene is concerned in creating conditions in
industry which will prevent accidents, promote public and
personal health by eliminating adverse influences, and in creating
environmental conditions which will prolong the worker’s
life by improving the conditions under which he labors. Public
health, mortality and morbidity are influenced more by the
environmental conditions in the occupations than by any other
factor in human life. At least two-thirds of the entire human
life is spent in some occupation and the danger of life, limb
and health is well known to all.</p>

<p>The various industries differ largely in their effects upon
the workers, the mortality in some being greater than in
others; accidents are more numerous in some than others,
some occupations being more hazardous. Some dis-eases
occur more frequently in certain occupations. The environment
may necessitate a greater adaptation in one part of the
body than in another; a very dusty work, for example, will
affect the respiratory tract while another occupation will affect
a different part of the body.</p>


<h3>Effect of Occupation upon Health</h3>

<p>It is obvious that occupations have a certain effect upon
the adaptative processes of the body as well as producing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
traumatic conditions from accidents, which result in total or
partial disability, sudden death, or acute or chronic conditions
from poisoning for example. In the industries there may be
such adverse environments as to draw so heavily upon the
adaptative forces that the body will be reduced to a greatly
weakened state. The personal health of the individual enters
as a conditioning factor, as well as do his peculiarities and
personal weaknesses.</p>


<h3>Personal Factors</h3>

<p>The individual with low vitality, poor nutrition and poor
elimination will be affected to a greater extent in some occupations
than in others. The person with a subluxation at lung
place, lessening the resistance of the tissues in this zone, will
find that an occupation which necessitates breathing air laden
with dust will affect the lungs because of their already
weakened condition. Many accidents which jeopardize the
health and life of workers result from carelessness or from a
lack of knowledge about the devices employed.</p>


<h3>Choice of Occupation</h3>

<p>Great care should be exercised in the choice of an occupation.
This should not be left to chance nor to the ignorant
fancy of the youth. The occupations which will best suit the
idiosyncrasies of the individual both mentally and physically
should be selected. Many lives are shortened because of the
unwise choice of occupation. The individual with defective
lungs should not select a dusty trade, nor the physically weak
person a trade which requires an enormous amount of muscular
strength. In other words, a trade should be carefully
selected with a view to the weak and strong points of the
individual.</p>

<p>In this question of a choice in employment the sex should
be taken into consideration. While there are many occupations
in which women are as competent or more competent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
than men, yet there are several factors to be weighed. Taken
as a general rule, women are not as strong physically as men.
There are some occupations which have a very detrimental
effect upon the reproductive organs. Statistics show that
women are more easily affected by industrial poisons than
men. Congestion of the reproductive organs during menstruation
is increased and if women are compelled to work
at certain occupations during this menstrual period, they will
certainly find it detrimental to their health.</p>

<p>It is a recognized fact, according to many authorities on
the subject, that there is a larger percentage of abortions and
miscarriages among women in industries than among women
in domestic life. The infant mortality is also very much
higher. Many abortions and miscarriages result from the
effects of industrial poisoning, as well as from heavy and
continuous work.</p>


<h3>Effect of Labor upon Children</h3>

<p>The most injurious effects from occupation are those upon
children since they are more susceptible to the ill effects than
adults. The child should have every advantage for the
development of all parts of his body that there may be no
interference with its proper growth. Attention should be
given to his mental and moral development. These things
can not receive proper attention if the child is forced to labor
under adverse conditions just at the time when the body is
developing.</p>

<p>Many occupations are such that curvatures of the spine
are produced and different parts of the body overtaxed. Child
labor should be prohibited. There is no labor so expensive
to our country as child labor. If our children are not given
an opportunity to develop physically, mentally and morally,
we will suffer in citizenship in the next generation. There is
bound to be a deterioration from such procedure.</p>

<p>The organs of the child are peculiarly susceptible to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
effects of overwork and fatigue; the entire body is in the
process of development and its development may be retarded
and its growth seriously hindered. It is a most excellent
thing to keep the child employed and active, but there certainly
should be a means of protecting him from the avarice
and greed of heartless employers. The best way to do this
is to keep him out of gainful employment until there has been
sufficient physical development to insure against overtaxing
the young body.</p>


<h3>Place of Work</h3>

<p>The influence of the occupation upon health will be governed
not only by the character of the work, but also by the
environment in which the work is performed. Whether it is
indoor or outdoor work, whether it is an active or sedentary
occupation, and whether there are extremes in the temperature,
humidity, air pressure or light, or whether the work is
on the surface or below it as in mines, are all factors. The
position of the worker, the length of the working hours, the
physical, mental and nervous strain all have a bearing on
health. Outdoor work is preferred, especially for those who
are inclined to pulmonary or respiratory disorders, because of
the difference in the purity of the air. Outdoor workers suffer
less from fatigue and their mortality rate is lower.</p>


<h3>Effect of Posture</h3>

<p>Posture of the workman is not without its effect upon
the health and its bearing upon industrial hygiene is very
important. There are many conditions that have their beginning
in the occupation, such as faulty development of different
parts of the body, curvatures of the spine, and especially those
which are adaptative. Many subluxations are produced by
posture assumed during long hours of work. In analyzing
such cases chiropractically, the history of the occupation and
the posture assumed should be carefully considered so that in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
adjusting the subluxated vertebrae there may be no opposition
to the adaptative processes of Innate Intelligence in her endeavor
to compensate for the faulty posture.</p>

<p>Sedentary occupations such as typing, bookkeeping, shoe-making,
engraving and tailoring result in lack of muscular
activity and produce characteristic occupational disorders and
deformities. It is not natural for an individual to remain in
any one posture for the greater part of the day. Innate needs
to have the body more or less active so that the proper adaptative
processes can be carried on within the body.</p>

<p>Sitting constantly at a desk will create a tendency to
stooped shoulders and thus cramp the respiratory organs.
The result will be a lack of proper oxygenation of the blood
which will have its effect upon the metabolic processes of
the body. There will be a sluggishness of the liver and other
vital organs, and a tendency to anemia, constipation, general
lack of muscular tone and low vitality.</p>

<p>Active occupations exercise the natural processes of the
body and create a necessity for the action of Innate in all
parts of the body. Activity keeps the muscles in tone and
makes the processes of elimination more active. Activity is
one of Nature’s laws and is essential in the vital expressions
of life in the body. This is shown by the provisions Nature
has made for such activity. Especially are the active occupations
to be preferred over the sedentary for young people and
for those up to the age of forty-five or fifty. After this age
the sedentary occupations are not so detrimental.</p>


<h3>Fatigue</h3>

<p>Fatigue comes as a result of overwork and is a purely personal
factor since the amount of work that may be performed
before producing fatigue will vary in different individuals.
Fatigue is produced by an accumulation of toxines and waste
material in the body when katabolism is greater than anabolism.
This may be brought on by overtaxing the body to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
point where it is impossible for Innate Intelligence to rebuild
the tissues as rapidly as they are being torn down. It can
readily be seen that if there should be an accumulation of
waste material from faulty metabolism due to interference
with transmission, fatigue would be produced sooner and
with less work than in the individual normally excreting the
poisons.</p>

<p>If one part of the body or one set of muscles is overworked
fatigue neurosis will be produced. There may be loss of motor
function due, not to interference with transmission of motor
mental impulses, but to the fact that the organ, usually a
muscle, becomes an unfit medium for the expression of the
mental impulses. A good illustration of this is writer’s cramp,
and cramps among typesetters and telegraphers. In these
cases, however, there are usually local subluxations that
should be adjusted.</p>


<h2>HYGIENE AND SANITATION OF INDUSTRIAL
ESTABLISHMENTS</h2>


<h3>Space Per Individual</h3>

<p>In some states the legislatures have established a minimum
of 400 cubic feet of space for each individual, but this is not
sufficient in some occupations and under some conditions.
The amount of space per workman must of necessity be governed
by several factors: namely, character of the work performed,
character of the building, the hygienic conditions of
same, the type of ventilation used, whether natural or mechanical,
and the methods of heating and lighting. In some trades
and under certain conditions 1000 cubic feet space per workman
would not be excessive.</p>


<h3>Character of Buildings</h3>

<p>When practicable the building should be constructed especially
for the kind of work to be carried on within. It should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
be fireproof and of a material that will lend to the hygienic
demands in industry.</p>

<p>We do not want to pass over this subject without calling
the student’s attention to the effect which may be produced
by the physical, mental and nervous strain under which the
work is performed. If the worker is under great tension a
great amount of energy will be used up and fatigue will appear
early. This will have a marked effect upon the individual and
tend to lessen his efficiency. If work is performed under great
physical strain, the muscular activity is greater than the
muscles are able to express. Then there will be not only
fatigue but actual injury done the muscles and other structures.
Under such conditions the vital organs will also be
overtaxed. This may result in dilatation of the heart, hernia,
aneurysms, or in a general weakened condition of the body.
The results of mental strain, responsibility and worry are not
without their adverse effects.</p>


<h3>Lighting, Heating and Ventilating Work Places</h3>

<p>Industrial hygiene should be concerned about the temperature,
humidity, air pressure, light, ventilation, and heating of
the work place. The building should be well lighted. If possible
natural light should be provided even though the first
cost is considerably greater than that of artificial lighting.
There will not only be a better grade of work done in natural
light and with less eye strain, but the general health of the
workmen will be better. If artificial lighting is used it should
be electric light, since it produces less impurities and provides
a more even light. The light should be evenly distributed
and of a proper distance from workmen so that it will not be
reflected directly into their eyes. If the occupation takes the
worker out of doors then these features can not be controlled,
but in this event attention must be given to the clothing of
the workman. Sudden changes in the temperature should
be avoided as much as possible. Innate is capable of adapting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
the body to extremes in temperature, but must be given a
sufficient amount of time in which to bring about these
changes. Men may work in the frigid temperature or in the
torrid temperature and if properly clothed and acclimated will
suffer no ill effects.</p>

<p>In many industries the laborers are forced to work in
artificially high temperatures. Blast-furnace workers, glass
blowers, miners, bakers, and stokers must remain in extremely
high temperatures. The body may be adapted to such temperature,
but the effect of the continued expenditure of
energy necessary to bring about this adaptation will show
adverse effects upon the body. There is a tendency to
respiratory disorders and a thickening of the blood plasma
which disrupts the circulatory system. Heat also has a
detrimental effect upon the eyes and there is a tendency to
rheumatism.</p>

<p>Air of a high relative humidity is objectionable from a
hygienic standpoint because it interferes with perspiration
and evaporation. Workers constantly exposed to atmosphere
that is too damp will have a tendency to incoördinations involving
the bodily secretions and respiratory disorders. The
ill effects of such an environment are rather marked and if
it is necessary to maintain a high relative humidity because
of the processes carried on there must be special provision
to guard the health of the workers. This may be accomplished
by short hours and frequent periods of rest and relief from
the high humidity.</p>

<p>Normal air pressure is fifteen pounds to the square inch,
but there are many industries in which the work must be done
under a greater or a less pressure. Mountain climbers are subjected
to decreased air pressure while caisson workers and
divers must work under greatly increased air pressure. Decreased
air pressure is especially detrimental to those suffering
from cardiac disorders, and may in some cases result in death.
The effects of increased air pressure have been elaborated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
upon in another chapter and the student is referred to that
section.</p>

<p>The location of the work is important. Subsurface work
is more detrimental to health than surface work unless special
precautions have been taken to make the place of work conducive
to the expression of life. Subsurface workers such as
miners are subjected to great heat, lack of proper light and
ventilation, accumulated gases, dampness and poisons. There
is also greater danger from accidents and explosions.</p>


<h3>Industrial Dusts</h3>

<p>In a trade in which much dust is produced there should
be proper mechanical ventilation. The vacuum and plenum
system should be employed. There is no factor in the industrial
life more detrimental to the workman than that forcing
him to breathe vitiated air laden with dust and other
impurities produced by the processes employed in the trades.</p>

<p>The extremely dusty trades should be separated from the
less dusty ones and special provision made to carry away the
dust. It is often possible to substitute machinery for handwork
in these trades. When the laborers are forced to work
in very thick dust they may be protected in a measure by
the use of respirators worn over the mouth and nose. These
will catch some of the dust and act as filters.</p>

<p>It is often possible to place hoods directly above the machines
in these trades and by means of a vacuum fan the dust
is carried out through tubes.</p>

<p>The effects of dust upon the worker depend upon many
factors. These might, however, be classified as conditioning
factors in the individual and the character of the dust inhaled.</p>

<p>Dust from metals and minerals may produce mechanical
injury to the membrane of the respiratory tract because of
the sharp edges. Inhalation of dust might also bring about
catarrhal conditions and coughs. There may be deposits of
dust in the bronchi and even in the parenchyma of the lungs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
from long exposure to and inhalation of dust. This may result
in consolidation and other conditions which may be purely
adaptative on the part of Innate Intelligence to compensate
for the presence of the foreign substances.</p>

<p>In F. Hoffman’s Bulletin of the Bureau of Labor, Vol.
LXXIX, he gives the following classification of dusty trades
according to the character of the dust produced:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<b>Group I</b>—Exposure to Metallic Dust: Grinders, polishers,
tool and instrument makers, jewelers, gold leaf and brass
workers, printers, engravers and pressmen.</p>

<p>“<b>Group II</b>—Exposure to Mineral Dust: Stone, marble
and cement workers, glass blowers, glass cutters, diamond
cutters, potters, plasterers, paperhangers, moulders, core
makers and lithographers.</p>

<p>“<b>Group III</b>—Exposure to Vegetable-fiber Dust: Cotton
ginning, textile, linen, hemp, cordage and paper manufacturers,
weavers, spinners, hosiery knitters, lace makers, jute and
wood workers.</p>

<p>“<b>Group IV</b>—Exposure to Animal and Mixed Dust: Furriers,
taxidermists, hatters, silk, wool, and worsted workers,
carpet, rug, rag, and shoddy workers, hair mattress workers
and upholsterers.”</p>
</div>

<p>The mortality rate from pulmonary tuberculosis and other
respiratory incoördinations is very high in the dusty trades.</p>


<h2>INDUSTRIAL POISONS</h2>

<p>In the case of poisonous gases and fumes the necessity
becomes even greater for proper prophylactic measures. The
methods used in dusty trades may be here employed, but with
greater care. All poisonous materials should be eliminated
as far as possible and less objectionable material substituted.
This may be done in a great many instances without decreasing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
the value of the article manufactured. An illustration of
this is in the substitution of red phosphorus for the use of the
more poisonous yellow phosphorus in the manufacture of
matches. This eliminates danger from phosphorus poisoning.</p>

<p>Price states: “The chief industrial poisons are lead, arsenic
and mercury, although phosphorus, copper, zinc, brass, and
chromium poisoning are frequently met with in various industries.”</p>


<h3>Lead Poisoning</h3>

<p>The symptoms produced by lead poisoning are: lead colic
in acute cases, loss of appetite, cramps, pain in the joints.
There will be bluish lines found along the edge of the gums;
wrist drop and loss of motor function in the hands and feet;
arteriosclerosis, indigestion, restlessness during sleep, anemia,
lead palsy, loss of strength and weight and constipation. The
patient experiences a disagreeable sweetish taste, and there
will be a grayish pallor and pinched expression of the face.
In severe cases there may be blindness, great fatigue, apoplexy,
insanity and death.</p>

<p>The greatest danger from lead comes in the form of dust
or fumes and therefore the poison enters the body principally
through the respiratory tract, but it may enter through the
digestive tract and through the skin.</p>

<p>Prophylactic measures include devices to protect the workmen
by means of respirators, but special effort should be made
to keep the air in the breathing zone free from the dust and
fumes. Since the poison may be taken in through the skin,
special provision should be made to protect the hands and
arms in fingering the materials. The workmen should exercise
the greatest cleanliness and precaution to prevent ingestion
of the lead into the digestive tract. Care should be taken
that it is not brought into the mouth by the fingers or by
pipe, for example. There is a high mortality from pulmonary
tuberculosis among lead workers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span></p>


<h3>Arsenic Poisoning</h3>

<p>The mouth, lungs and skin are the portals of entry for
arsenic into the body. Arsenic poisoning is characterized by
catarrhal inflammation of the eyes and respiratory tract,
anemia, neuritis, gastritis, and degenerative changes in the
liver and kidneys. Many of the symptoms of arsenic poisoning
resemble those of lead poisoning such as gastric disturbances,
anorexia, anemia and loss of strength. There may be progressive
muscular atrophy, eczematous eruptions and ulcers of the
lips, nostrils and in the folds of the skin.</p>

<p>Arsenic is used in the manufacture of wall paper, artificial
flowers, textile fabrics; by taxidermists and as a preservative
for hides; it is also used in different preparations to kill insects
and parasites.</p>


<h3>Mercurial Poisoning</h3>

<p>Mercury enters the body through the digestive and respiratory
tracts and through the skin. The symptoms usually manifest
in this kind of industrial poisoning are headache, gastric
disturbances, stomatitis, metallic taste in the mouth and fetid
breath; there is swelling and ulceration of the gums that cause
the teeth to become loose, and there may be an excessive flow
of saliva with a swelling of the submaxillary glands. In severe
cases there may be tremors, paralysis, melancholy and loss of
memory.</p>

<p>Mercury is used in the manufacture of incandescent lamps
where they employ mercury pumps, in the manufacture of
barometers and thermometers, in the felt and fur industries,
in the manufacture of pharmaceutical preparations and chemical
works, and in photography.</p>

<p>Methods used to prevent mercurial poisoning are almost
identical with those used in lead poisoning. Special devices
should be provided to keep the air in the breathing zone free
from the fumes. This can best be accomplished by providing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
a proper system of mechanical ventilation. The workmen
should wear rubber gloves to lessen the possibilities of the
absorption through the skin. The workmen should also practice
cleanliness and exercise care that mercury is not carried
into the mouth by the hands which should be thoroughly
washed before eating.</p>


<h3>Phosphorus Poisoning</h3>

<p>The industrial poison of next importance is phosphorus.
This poisoning is confined almost entirely to the match industry.
There are two kinds of phosphorus, the yellow or
white, and the amorphous or red. The yellow is poisonous
and is used in making the “strike anywhere” matches. This,
however, is being replaced by the non-poisonous, or more
harmless red phosphorus. The safety matches contain no
phosphorus and are harmless.</p>

<p>Phosphorus poisoning produces gastric disturbances,
bronchial catarrh and caries of the teeth with necrosis of the
lower maxillary. Other bones of the body may also be affected
by necrosis.</p>

<p>Brass, copper, zinc, and bronze workers are also affected
by the dust and fumes from these poisons. Brass workers
suffer with brass founders’ ague in which there are chills,
vomiting, headache and general depression.</p>


<h3>Chromium Poisoning</h3>

<p>Chromium is also responsible for industrial poisoning. It
is used in the manufacture of dyes and in the coloring of wall
paper and fabrics. It affects the mucous membrane lining the
nose and throat and produces an inflammation of the eyes
and ulceration of the skin.</p>

<p class="center no-indent fs120 bold">DEFINITIONS</p>


<h3>Dis-ease</h3>

<p>Webster defines dis-ease as, “an alteration in the state of
the body or of some of its organs, interrupting or disturbing
the performance of the vital functions, or a particular instance
or cause of this; any departure from the state of health
presenting marked symptoms.” In using this word chiropractically
it is always hyphenated to indicate that it is a
condition wherein there is a lack of ease. Incoördination is
the term used in Chiropractic, meaning a lack of coördinate
action in the body which is caused by interference with transmission
of mental impulses.</p>


<h3>Classification</h3>

<p>Dis-eases are usually classified as constitutional and environmental.
A constitutional dis-ease is one that is due to
defects in the structures of the body such as dis-ease of digestion,
while environmental dis-eases are attributed to extrinsic
environmental conditions. The infectious dis-eases are given
in this class. Chiropractically all dis-eases are brought on
by interference with transmission of mental impulses caused
by defective mechanism of the spinal column. The so-called
environmental dis-eases are chiropractically the result of the
lack of adaptation to environmental conditions.</p>


<h3>Acute and Chronic</h3>

<p>Dis-eases are also considered to be acute or chronic.
A dis-ease is in the acute stage when there is a “hot box”
found at the causative subluxation. When adaptation has
taken place and the “hot box” has disappeared, the condition
is in the stage of chronicity. Taut fibers will then be present<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
and by their presence the palpation and location of the major
subluxation may be verified.</p>

<p>It is well for the student to understand what is meant by
such expressions as the stage of exposure, the period of infection,
the stage of incubation, the period of invasion, the degree
of infection, even though we have no particular reason to use
such terms in our chiropractic explanations of dis-ease.</p>


<h3>Stage of Exposure</h3>

<p>The time during which the person is exposed to the morbific
agents is known as the stage of exposure.</p>


<h3>Period of Infection</h3>

<p>The period of infection is the time during which the pathogenic
germs actually enter the body.</p>


<h3>Stage of Incubation</h3>

<p>The stage of incubation is the time during which the
morbific agents develop within the body and for the time
being have overcome the natural resistance. The incubation
period varies greatly in different so-called contagious dis-eases,
it being governed largely by the character of the invading
germs and the general health of the patient.</p>


<h3>Period of Invasion</h3>

<p>The time during which the germs remain in the body is
called the period of invasion.</p>


<h3>Degree of Infection</h3>

<p>The vital resistance of the body, the portal of entry and
the character of the invading germs determines the degree
of infection.</p>

<p>We wish again to call the student’s attention to the fact that
these expressions are not used chiropractically to explain the
cause of dis-ease nor the different stages through which dis-ease
passes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span></p>


<h3>Contagious</h3>

<p>A contagious dis-ease is one that is thought to be transferred
from one individual to another by personal contact.
From the etymology of the term (contingere, to touch) we
would conclude that only such dis-eases as syphilis would
come under this category. But as the term is generally understood
it includes such dis-eases as smallpox, measles and
chickenpox.</p>


<h3>Infectious</h3>

<p>An infectious dis-ease is one that is supposed to be conveyed
from one individual to another indirectly through some
medium. Typhoid fever has been given as an infectious
dis-ease.</p>

<p>Today it is generally considered that the terms, contagious
and infectious, do not have a precise meaning which will
scientifically differentiate them, for most of the so-called communicable
dis-eases may be conveyed in many different ways.
The so-called infectious dis-eases may be contagious and the
so-called contagious dis-eases are infectious; so we see the
terms lack scientific precision and this has led to confusion
many times.</p>


<h3>Morbific Agents</h3>

<p>Morbific agents are those agents which are thought capable
of producing dis-ease when introduced into the body. They
are of vegetable or animal origin. Those of vegetable origin
are classed under the general name of bacteria. The most
important are named according to their form. Those of the
spherical shape are known as cocci; the elongated, rod-like
form, as bacilli; and those of spiral form, as spirilli. The
streptococcus pyogenes, pneumococcus and gonococcus are
illustrations of the cocci. The most common pathogenic bacilli
are bacillus anthracis, bacillus tetani, bacillus typhosus, bacillus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
tuberculosis and bacillus influenzæ. The most usual spirilla
are vibrio cholera asiatica, spirillum of relapsing fever and
spirochæta pallida. Pathogenic action of germs upon the
body may be mechanical, biological or chemical. The mechanical
action is an interference with the physiological activity
of the organs, causing stasis and hemorrhage. The biological
action causes inflammation, infiltration and abscesses in the
tissues. The chemical action is the result of the toxins formed
by the action of the germs. This is by far the most important
action.</p>


<h3>Pathogenic Germs</h3>

<p>Microörganisms are spoken of as being pathogenic and
non-pathogenic according to the adaptative action produced
by Innate Intelligence when they are introduced into the body.
Pathogenic germs are those which will do harm to the host
when introduced under certain circumstances. It has been
demonstrated that a germ may be pathogenic to one host and
non-pathogenic to another. A germ may be pathogenic to
a host at one time and not at another, showing that immunity
is not constant in the same individual. The pathogenicity of
a germ depends upon the host and not upon the germ.
Chiropractic has proven that germs will not harm the
body unless there is interference with the transmission of
mental impulses so that Innate Intelligence can not bring
about the proper adaptative action to the presence of the
germs.</p>


<h3>Non-Pathogenic Germs</h3>

<p>When there is complete adaptative action on the part of
Innate Intelligence and the germs are excreted immediately
without the production of symptoms or ill effects to the body,
the germs are said to be non-pathogenic. This is not so much
because of the character of the germs but because of the
ability of Innate to excrete them as waste material.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span></p>


<h3>Communicability</h3>

<p>This term refers to the ease with which the germs pass
from one host to another. Chiropractic has proven the fallacy
of the theory that dis-ease is produced in this way. Patients
become ill with the so-called communicable dis-eases and are
not exposed to the germs that are supposed to cause the dis-ease.
It is also a proven fact that the so-called germ dis-eases
develop in many cases in which there are no germs to be
found in the pathological tissue.</p>


<h3>Host</h3>

<p>The host is an organism which affords lodgment and sustenance
to parasite and commensal organisms. The invading
organisms may be beneficial, they may be harmful or they
may produce no effect.</p>


<h3>Parasites</h3>

<p>Parasites are those living organisms, either plant or animal,
which live in, on, or with some other living organism, known
as the host, from which they obtain their food, shelter and
other advantages. They are of two classes—ectoparasites and
endoparasites—and may be either plant or animal organisms.
An ectoparasite is one that lives upon the outside of another
living organism known as the host. The endoparasite is one
that lives within the body of the host.</p>


<h3>Commensal</h3>

<p>A commensal is an organism which lives in or on another
organism and shares the shelter and partakes of the same
food as the host, but is not in reality a parasite. It is a close
association of two organisms for the benefit of one or both.</p>


<h3>Antibiosis</h3>

<p>This is a form of parasitism which is harmful to either host
or parasite or to both. By this process of antibiosis water<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
may be purified of many of the pathogenic germs. It is also
maintained that in many instances there is but one major condition
in the body at one time as a result of this process.</p>


<h3>Symbiosis</h3>

<p>In this form of parasitism the organisms are dissimilar,
but neither is harmful to the other while the state is beneficial
to one or both. Symbiosis will result in one condition becoming
conducive to another condition as, for example, presence
of certain microörganisms favors the development of tetanus.
Germs are sometimes cultivated in symbiosis with other germs.
This has been done with the germs that are found in leprosy.</p>


<h3>Antibodies</h3>

<p>Antibodies are bodies as the term would indicate, but refers
to specific properties of the blood supposed to be produced
by antigens and thought to accomplish a certain degree of
immunity.</p>


<h3>Antigens</h3>

<p>Antigens are the substances which produce the antibodies
in the blood and body fluids. These are merely terms used
to designate the mechanism of immunity.</p>


<h3>Saprophytes</h3>

<p>Saprophytes are microscopic organisms which feed upon
dead organic matter. A saprophyte is a vegetable organism.</p>


<h3>Obligate Saprophytes</h3>

<p>Obligate saprophytes are saprophytes which can not be
made to develop under any circumstances in living tissue, but
will develop in dead tissue in which they produce toxins. The
diphtheria and tetanus bacilli develop in a localized area of
dead tissue and produce the toxins peculiar to this condition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span></p>


<h3>Septicemia</h3>

<p>Septicemia is a condition wherein so-called pathogenic
bacteria and their accompanying poisons are present in the
blood. These bacteria may develop within the blood or
they may be carried into the blood from some local point
where they are developing due to the condition of the
tissues as a result of interference with transmission of mental
impulses.</p>


<h3>Toxemia</h3>

<p>Toxemia is a condition caused by the absorption of toxins
from the bacterial activity. This is commonly known as blood
poisoning.</p>


<h3>Sapremia</h3>

<p>Sapremia is a condition wherein the blood contains the
putrefactive products of saprophytic and non-pathogenic
bacteria.</p>


<h3>Epidemic</h3>

<p>When a great number of people are affected in a community
by the same dis-ease in a short period of time it is
said to be an epidemic. An epidemic is said to obtain when
dis-ease breaks out suddenly and involves a number of persons
at one time. There is a wide difference of opinion as to the
percentage of individuals necessarily involved to constitute
an epidemic.</p>


<h3>Endemic</h3>

<p>A dis-ease that is limited to a certain class of people or
peculiar to a certain locality or district is said to be endemic.
Endemic differs from epidemic in that epidemic refers to a
dis-ease that is more or less constantly present.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span></p>


<h3>Sporadic</h3>

<p>A dis-ease occurring singly or affecting only a few people
is said to be sporadic.</p>


<h3>Pandemic</h3>

<p>When an epidemic involves a large number of people in a
large number of countries, it is known as pandemic. There
is a question as to whether or not the word can ever be properly
used. It is claimed that the influenza epidemic of 1918-19
could really be considered pandemic in view of the fact that
the condition was found in all countries.</p>

<p>These terms are used very loosely and are applied largely
to suit the circumstances. A number of cases of a so-called
contagious dis-ease occurring about the same time in a community
may be considered an epidemic by some. There is no
established rule designating the percentage of individuals that
must be affected by the same condition in order that an
epidemic may be established. An endemic dis-ease may become
epidemic at certain times of the year or when a greater
number of people than usual become affected. A sporadic
dis-ease may become epidemic when a greater number of
people become affected.</p>


<h3>Fomites</h3>

<p>Fomites are substances capable of absorbing and retaining
infectious germs. The term is applied to inanimate objects
and usually refers to bedding, especially mattresses, clothing
and more particularly to woolen clothing. Such vectors, however,
are not now receiving as much consideration as they
did previously. It is no longer thought that such objects as
books and furniture play any particular part in the spreading
of so-called infectious dis-ease.</p>

<p>The foregoing definitions will give the student understanding
of the terminology in general use. We will now take up
a consideration of the study of the subject proper of immunity.</p>

<p class="center no-indent fs120 bold">IMMUNITY</p>


<h3>Defined</h3>

<p>Immunity is defined as the ability of Innate Intelligence
to maintain metabolic equilibrium in the body in the environments
in which man finds himself; or that power of Innate
Intelligence to rid the living body of poisons and invading
organisms; or that resistance which is accomplished through
the expression of mental impulses in the tissue cells whereby
all invading microörganisms or toxins are expelled from
the body, thereby enabling the normal expression of life in the
body. The degree of immunity may be represented by the
degree of intellectual adaptation possible in the body, and this
in turn depends upon the freedom in the transmission of
mental impulses through the spinal nerves. Immunity may
be considered as the degree of protection which Innate is able
to give the body and varies from a slight adaptation to the
utmost adaptation or protection from all invading agencies.</p>

<p>Immunity is one of the most interesting and yet the most
illusive and complicated subjects which we will have to consider
from the standpoint of chiropractic philosophy, for in
order to understand immunity we must understand the adaptative
processes carried on within the body. From time immemorial
man has made an effort to immunize himself from
the ravages of dis-ease. In former times he tried to accomplish
this through the use of charms which led to many
superstitious practices, some remnants of which have survived
to the present day. In recent years large sums of money have
been expended in scientific research in an effort to discover
the secret which would make the human race immune from
dis-ease, but to no avail. It is a recognized fact that great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
good has been accomplished in improving conditions and
creating an environment in which there might be a more perfect
expression of life with less necessity for an excessive
expenditure of adaptative energy. But man himself has not
been made immune by these methods. The procedure has
been wrong for the cause of dis-ease is not in man’s environment,
but within man himself. Chiropractic will accomplish
the most desired end by restoring to normal the transmission
of mental impulses to all parts of the body so there may be
a complete adaptation to all environmental conditions that
may arise. The body will then be protected from the supposedly
deadly microörganisms that are accused of being
responsible for human ills.</p>

<p>If the public could read what the hygienists have to say
on the subject of immunology and could read it in the light
of chiropractic philosophy they would realize that chiropractic
adjustments will not only restore health to the sick, but will
prevent the well from getting sick.</p>

<p>In order that the student may understand the subject more
fully we will now consider briefly in a general way some of
the former theories of immunity and then take up a careful
study of the chiropractic philosophy of immunity.</p>

<p>On page 528 of <cite>Preventive Medicine and Hygiene</cite>, by
Rosenau, we read: “We are still ignorant of the mechanism
by which the body protects itself against many dis-eased
states.” He also gives us the idea that the mechanism of
immunity varies not only in different infections, but in the
same infection when under different and varying conditions.</p>


<h3>Natural Immunity</h3>

<p>Immunity is classed as natural, acquired and artificial.
Natural immunity is that natural resistance of Innate Intelligence
through the activity in the normal body whereby
all invading organisms and poisons, as well as all the products
of katabolism are excreted before they have an opportunity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
to act upon the tissues or otherwise interfere with the vital
processes in the body.</p>


<h3>Acquired Immunity</h3>

<p>Acquired immunity is the result of the adaptative processes
of Innate Intelligence during the time the so-called dis-ease is
active in the body which results in the recovery of the patient.
To illustrate: During the attack of measles there is an adaptative
process carried on which results in the recovery of the
patient. During the process of this adaptation Innate produces
changes in the body which makes possible the excretion of
this kind of poison when introduced into the body in the
future. It is a recognized fact, however, that having a dis-ease
will not always prevent the recurrence of the dis-ease.
In other words, to put it in the terminology familiar to all,
having a dis-ease will not always produce immunity.</p>


<h3>Artificial Immunity</h3>

<p>Artificial immunity is classified as active and passive.
George M. Price, M.D., in his <cite>Hygiene and Public Health</cite>,
says: “Active immunity is produced by the following conditions:
(1) Recovery from dis-ease. (2) Inoculation with
virulent living bacteria. (3) Vaccination with attenuated bacteria;
(4) with dead bacteria; (5) with bacterial extracts.
Passive immunity is conferred by antitoxins and serums.”</p>

<p>The idea here presented is that the immunity is active if
it is the result of a necessity for internal intellectual adaptation
on the part of Innate Intelligence, and when this adaptation
takes place there will be immunity from further attacks.
That the passive immunity is produced by the introduction of
antitoxins or serums taken from the bodies of animals in whose
bodies these adaptative processes have taken place.</p>

<p>There is no possible way of producing immunity except by
creating a condition in the body which will enable Innate
Intelligence to transmit the mental impulses to the tissues in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
such quantity and quality that there may be perfect adaptation
carried on regardless of the character of the poison or microörganism
that may be introduced into or manufactured within
the body.</p>


<h3>Exhaustion Theory</h3>

<p>In 1888 Pasteur advanced the exhaustion theory wherein
he maintained that the body which had no food for the germ
to feed upon would be immune; in other words, when the food
supply was used up the germ could no longer develop and
grow. An illustration of this is the yeast which will cease
to grow when the sugar in the culture media is exhausted.
This theory was rejected but has since been revived and is
now considered to have some merit. This theory comes very
nearly agreeing with the chiropractic idea, which will be discussed
later.</p>


<h3>Retention Theory</h3>

<p>Another theory is that of Chaveau, which is known as the
retention theory. This is just the opposite of the exhaustion
theory and maintains that the products of metabolism within
the microörganisms, the excreta of the germs, form a toxin
or a substance which is retained in the body of the host and
protects it against the growth and development of the germs,
in this way producing immunity.</p>

<p>That which can not be used in the metabolism of an
organism will naturally be excreted, for if it is allowed to
remain in the body it will impair the tissues. The excreta of
the germ then can not be used in its own metabolism and is
therefore a poison to the germ as well as to the host. This
waste accumulates until the germ eventually is destroyed by
the poison of its own excreta. This is given as an explanation
of self-limited dis-eases. It is further explained by this theory
that this poisonous excreta of the germ is retained in the secretions
of the body of the host and acts as a protection against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
further invasion, for when other germs of the same character
enter the body they come in contact with this poison and are
destroyed. In this way immunity is supposed to be maintained.
But this is not logical, since the excreta of these germs
can not be used in the metabolic processes of the human body.
It is a poison and will be dealt with by Innate as such. Innate
does one of two things when poison enters the body or when
it is manufactured within the body. One is to eliminate it
through the normal channels of excretion; the other is to
produce an antidote in the form of an internal secretion to
neutralize the poison. In either event the excreta of the germ
would lose its potency as a germicide and could therefore have
nothing to do with the production of immunity.</p>


<h3>Various Theories</h3>

<p>Again, it is claimed that the phagocytes perform a very
important function in protecting the body against invading
microörganisms by attacking, destroying and digesting them.
Another theory is that the antibodies of various kinds play
an important part in keeping the body free from undesirable
invaders. It is also asserted that immunity is produced in a
negative way by the absence of a specific affinity between the
tissue cells and the toxin.</p>

<p>Immunity may be the result, according to other theories,
of a positive factor due to the presence of antibodies which
neutralize the toxins. In some cases immunity is associated
directly with cell activity while in others it is resident in the
blood and fluids of the body. Rosenau further says, “The
unsatisfactory state of our knowledge in certain fields of
immunity is well illustrated in the case of anthrax. The
mechanism of protection is not at all understood in this infection,
which was the first and classic illustration of a germ
dis-ease. The mechanism of immunity in common colds is also
complex and obscure.”</p>

<p>Many other authors could be quoted to show that the real<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
philosophy of immunity is not understood nor why a germ
will seem to cause dis-ease in one individual and not in another.
But this is sufficient to indicate the unsatisfactory
results that have been obtained in research work along this
line.</p>


<h3>Adaptability of the Body</h3>

<p>It is a known fact that there is a wide range of adaptability
and a vast difference in the vital resistance of different individuals,
and even in the same individual at different times.
There must be some reason for this difference.</p>

<p>It is also a known fact that an individual may be apparently
well one day and sick the next, although there may be no
change in the subluxations existing in the spine of the individual.
Environmental conditions are constantly arising
which necessitate adaptative action on the part of Innate Intelligence.
This action must be in addition to the normal action
taking place under the normal and usual environments. In
order to accomplish this increased functional activity the
current must be increased to accomplish this, the carrying
capacity of the nerve must be greater than the current necessary
to maintain the ordinary metabolic process in the
body.</p>

<p>Under the stress of environmental necessity it is possible
for Innate Intelligence to increase the functional current of
mental impulses up to the full carrying capacity of the nerve,
and to augment the functional activity at the periphery to the
full capability of the physical structure to express that current
of mental impulses. Were it not for this possibility of
increased functional activity there could be no adaptative
processes in the body. In order that there may be an increase
in the functional activity there must be an increase in the
functional current of mental impulses. This necessitates that
the current transmitted under normal conditions be less than
the carrying capacity of the nerve.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span></p>

<p>Psychologists tell us there is a certain amount of reserve
energy stored up in the body. Chiropractic maintains that
it is not a matter of energy being stored up, but that this
reserve energy is a question of increasing the functional current
so as to increase the process of adaptation in the tissues.
The degree of adaptation is represented by the difference in
the current transmitted through a nerve under normal conditions,
and that transmitted when the full carrying capacity
of the nerve is taxed. In other words, the reserve energy
is the difference between the current that is being transmitted
and that which it is possible to have transmitted.</p>

<p>As the adaptative action is increased in response to the
necessity there will be, in adverse ratio, a decrease in the
reserve carrying capacity of the nerve. In other words, as
the current is decreased the reserve carrying capacity of the
nerve is increased. The degree, therefore, of vital resistance
is represented by the reserve carrying capacity of the nerve
and as this is decreased there will be a like decrease in the
vital resistance of the body.</p>

<p>Some individuals are immune from certain so-called contagious
dis-eases and we are told that this is because the vital
resistance is greater in them than it is in others. This statement
is true, but there should be some reason for this difference
in resistance and Chiropractic gives us that reason.
The possibility for adaptative action in the body is decreased
by subluxations in the spine and its degree depends upon the
combination of subluxations, the functions involved and the
organs in which the functions are expressed abnormally.</p>

<p>The question, however, arises that if there are subluxations
in the spine, why are there no incoördinations but merely
the possibility of decreased adaptation. To this question
there is a specific answer. It is contained in the principles
involved in and underlying the philosophy of Chiropractic,
therefore it is not possible here to go into details. It can
be considered from a general viewpoint only.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span></p>

<p>There may be a combination of subluxations existing in
the spine and yet not enough pressure to prevent Innate
Intelligence getting a current through great enough to meet
all the ordinary demands of the average environment. But
when subluxations do exist and a condition arises necessitating
increased functional activity, Innate, because of the decreased
carrying capacity, is unable to increase the current of the
periphery. Hence adaptation can not take place and there is
incoördination which would not have obtained if the carrying
capacity of the nerves had not been decreased by the subluxation.
It must be remembered that even in the normal
condition when there are no subluxations, health is a question
of intellectual adaptation; that dis-ease is a question of the
lack of intellectual adaptation. As the possibilities of intellectual
adaptation are decreased, the possibilities of incoördination
are increased.</p>

<p>An individual will be immune so long as the carrying
capacity of the nerves remain normal or so long as the carrying
capacity is not decreased. Germs ingested or taken into
the body will be excreted as so much waste material and will
not be permitted to remain in the body. This is not only true
of germs and microörganisms, but of all poisons. The carrying
capacity of the nerves is limited, but in the normal condition
is 100%. If the poison introduced is stronger than
the internal resistance then the meeting of the two forces will
produce a concussion, and if this concussion is greater than
the normal resistance of the spine a subluxation will be produced.
In this way an individual may be immune from one
poison and not another, or from one particular germ and not
another, or he may be immune at one time and not at another
time. For the philosophy of subluxations being produced by
poison, the student is referred to Chiropractic Library, Vol. V,
Palmer, under the heading of poisons.</p>

<p>The particular mechanism of immunity is not so vital so
long as we understand that it is produced by the operation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
of Innate Intelligence, and know what is necessary to enable
Innate to produce this condition.</p>

<p>Under the exhaustion theory of Pasteur it was maintained
that when food upon which germs fed was exhausted they
could no longer develop and the body in which there was no
food for the germs would be immune from the germ dis-eases.
Chiropractic maintains that the germ is a scavenger and feeds
upon dead tissue, never upon live tissue; that there must be
a proper culture media for the development of the germs and
this can obtain only in tissue that is below the normal condition.
Therefore, if the tissues are maintained in a state of
normality by the normal transmission and expression of mental
impulses, there will be no food for the germs and they will be
excreted. On the other hand, if the tissues are below normal
in their resistive powers, due to the interference with the
transmission of mental impulses, the germs finding food and
a culture media conducive to their development will remain
and multiply and their excreta will act as a poison and necessitate
a further process of adaptation, the character of the symptoms
depending entirely upon the character of the poison
produced.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to kill the germ that the patient may
recover. All that is necessary is to adjust the subluxation
or subluxations that are causing the interference with the
transmission so the tissues may become normal and the germs
will starve to death and be excreted as dead material.</p>


<h3>Dis-ease the Cause of Germs</h3>

<p>Dr. Alexander M. Ross, Fellow of the Royal Society of
England, said in speaking of germs, “They are the result, not
the cause, of dis-ease. They are scavengers; their legitimate
work is to clean out the sewers of our bodies.”</p>

<p>John B. Fraser, M.D., CM., writes, “The reasons for questioning
the germ theory are mainly three, viz.:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span></p>

<p>“1st. The divergent views of bacteriologists as to which
germ caused the dis-ease.</p>

<p>“2nd. The stronger claim of the bio-chemic theory.</p>

<p>“3rd. The absence of germs at the onset of dis-ease (as
the following sample cases show).</p>

<p>“(a) A man crossing a river broke through the ice, was
rescued, later became ill, and the doctor, fearing pneumonia,
tested for pneumo-cocci—there were none present; when the
pneumonia developed they appeared.</p>

<p>“(b) After an oyster supper some men had cramps and
diarrhœa, followed by typhoid fever—no Eberth bacilli were
present in the first stools, but were present later.</p>

<p>“(c) Hurrying, a girl arrived at her shop sweating; as
the shop was cold, she became very chilly; next day complained
of a sore throat, but no Klebs-Loffler bacilli were
found; later, when a diphtheretic patch appeared, the bacilli
were present.</p>

<p>“Here in each case the bacilli followed the onset of the
dis-ease.</p>

<p>“Believing that the above germs were the result and not
the cause of the dis-eases, tests of the germs of diphtheria,
typhoid and pneumonia were made.</p>

<p>“The first test was whether the Klebs-Loffler bacilli would
cause diphtheria, and about 50,000 were swallowed without
any result. Later 100,000, 500,000 and a million and more
were swallowed, and in no case did they cause any ill-effect.</p>

<p>“The series of tests was to decide whether the Eberth
bacillus would cause typhoid, but each test was negative;
even when millions were swallowed. The third series of tests
showed that one could swallow a million (and over) pneumo-cocci
without causing pneumonia, or any disturbance.</p>

<p>“The investigations covered about two years and forty-five
(45) different tests were made, giving an average of fifteen
tests each. I personally tested each germ (culture) before
allowing the others to do so; and six persons (3 male, 3<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
female) knowingly took part in the tests and in no case did
any symptoms of the dis-ease follow.</p>

<p>“The germs were swallowed in each case, and were given
in milk, water, bread, cheese, meat, head-cheese, fish, and
apples—also tested on the tongue.</p>

<p>“Most of the cultures were grown by myself—some from
stock tubes furnished by Parke, Davis &amp; Co., and one tube
furnished by the Toronto Board of Health through one of
their bacteriologists.</p>

<p>“As the tests were carefully made, they prove that there
is not the danger from germs that bacteriologists claim; they
also may stimulate other Canadians to undertake further experimental
work, for the actual test on man decides the truth
of the theory.”</p>


<h3>Germs Do Not Cause Dis-ease</h3>

<p>Germs do not cause dis-ease, but they may be considered
as any other foreign substance taken into the body, which
can not be used in its metabolism. Any foreign substance
which can not be used in the processes of metabolism will
injure the tissues if allowed to remain in the body. If germs
are taken into the body and if there are subluxations which
prevent Innate from producing normal function in excreting
these germs, and if there is waste material due to impaired
metabolism, these germs will find a culture medium conducive to
their development; then in their natural processes of development
and metabolic processes, secretion and excretion, toxins
will be formed which will result in certain symptoms from
such poisons, all due to the fact that there are subluxations
producing pressure upon nerves interfering with the transmission
of mental impulses.</p>

<p>Immunity, then, is a question of keeping the body in such
a physical condition that there will be no abnormal tissue
upon which the germs may feed. But this would imply that
in order to have dis-ease there must first be abnormal tissue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
AND the germs. This, however, is not the case for there
may be dis-ease without the presence of the germ, even in the
so-called germ dis-eases. Dis-ease is not a question of germs
being present, but it is the decreased current of mental impulses
to the tissue cells.</p>

<p>The best way to produce immunity is to have the subluxations
adjusted so there may be a normal transmission of impulses
to all parts of the body so that intellectual adaptation
may be at par. Immunity from any and all dis-eases may be
produced by the restoration of transmission. This does not
mean that after momentum has been gained dis-ease will be
at once overcome and the process of restoration will be
accomplished without a sufficient amount of time to enable
Innate Intelligence to bring about the necessary processes of
restoration. But we do mean to say that if all subluxations
were adjusted the individual would be immune from all incoördinations.
Still subluxations could be produced by trauma
and also by the introduction of poisons into the body. In
order to maintain constant immunity the individual should
periodically visit his chiropractor for an analysis. By so
doing subluxations that have been produced may be detected
and adjusted.</p>

<h3>Origin of Germ Theory</h3>

<p>The average individual, who thinks of the cause of dis-ease
and then associates germs as that cause, probably does not
realize that the germ theory of the cause of dis-ease only
dates back to about 1880. He does not realize that the man
who decided germs cause dis-ease died in 1895. However, it
is true that as early as 1675 a Dutch lens-maker published
the fact that he had manufactured a lens of such high power
that “animalcules” could be seen in water. He also asserted
that microörganisms could be found in feces. However, they
were associated with dis-ease only in a speculative way; even
Aristotle in the second century speculated on microörganisms
as the cause of dis-ease, but this was only theory as he could
not prove it, having no microscopes with which to study the
germs nor any methods of isolating them. It was not until
Louis Pasteur began his research work in bacteriology that
scientists considered there was proof that germs caused dis-ease,
and since that time medical science has gone to the
extreme along this line.</p>

<p>The germ theory of dis-ease has gained such favor that
great amounts of money and the very best talent have been
lent to the investigations. But as time has gone on and the
zenith of this doctrine has been reached, we find the theory
has been questioned until today even those who were previously
advocates of this theory are now doubting or rejecting
it. Many questions are being raised concerning dis-ease being
the direct result of the introduction of bacteria and germs into
the body. It is now maintained by the best authorities, among<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
those who previously asserted that germs were the cause of
dis-ease, that dis-ease is the cause of the germs.</p>


<h3>Action of Germs a Natural Process</h3>

<p>The action of microörganisms, inside as well as outside the
body, is a perfectly natural process and one that has been
provided in Nature as a part of her general plan. It is a
natural method just the same as her method of purifying
the air or the self-purification of water or any of her other
beneficent processes are natural. Milk will not sour without
bacteria. Putrefaction is the result of the activity of the bacteria.
Did it ever occur to you that the process of putrefaction
is one of Nature’s methods for keeping our environment sanitary?
Even this process is obtained only through bacterial
action. Bacteria are always present in the intestinal tract and
aid in intestinal digestion.</p>

<p>The term is applied to all microscopic organisms, whether
vegetable or animal. Vegetable microörganisms are known as
bacteria while animal microörganisms are called protozoa.</p>


<h3>Bacteria</h3>

<p>Bacteria are the simplest form of vegetable life and also
the smallest. They vary greatly in size and are grouped in
three classes according to their shape: cocci, which are minute
spherical cells, bacilli, rod-shaped cells, and spirilla, which have
a spiral form.</p>

<p>There are three types of bacteria: the rod or bacillus, the
sphere or coccus, and the spiral or spirillum, all so named
because of their shape. They divide by what is known as
fission, each cell dividing into two and so on. When the
conditions are favorable this division may take place as often
as every thirty minutes.</p>

<p>They may be produced artificially in a proper culture
medium. It is generally supposed by the layman that the
bacteria are very hardy little creatures and will develop in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
body and cause dis-ease under the least provocation. This,
however, is quite erroneous for they are very delicate and
their propagation is difficult. The temperature and moisture
must be exactly right and they must have just the proper
kind of food or they will not multiply. They will live in an
environment, sometimes for a great length of time, that is
not suitable for propagation.</p>

<p>Diphtheric germs are found in the throat of the average
person. These germs, however, will not multiply nor develop
until the tissues of the throat are depleted. The tissues then
become pathological and form food for the bacteria, but even
then they will not develop unless the temperature and moisture
are exactly right. Bacteria multiply very rapidly when there
is waste material in the tissue of the throat which furnishes
food and when the environment is conducive to their development.
The tissues weakened by the decrease in the flow of
mental impulses are not able to expel the germs and they
accumulate, not as the cause of dis-ease, but as a result of
dis-ease. The bacteriologist examines a culture from the
throat of the patient and because he finds the germs present
he says the germs cause the dis-ease, since no other cause
is known; strange to say, however, when the patient is adjusted
and the tissues become normal it is not necessary to kill the
germs. They will starve to death and Innate will excrete
them.</p>

<p>Bacteria are found everywhere and in almost everything.
In food, water, on the walls and floors, and in the pores of
the skin. All life is due to the action of these bacteria. The
action of the germs soon produce fermentation and putrefaction
of dead animal tissue and of vegetables, thus reducing them
into simpler elements which furnish nourishment for plant
life. The plants furnish food for animals and man, and thus
we have what is known as the food cycle. So we see that
vegetation is dependent upon bacterial action for its supply
of food. If the bacteria were all destroyed there would soon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
be an end of food and plant life would die because of starvation.
If there was no plant life the animal kingdom would
be robbed of its food supply. Thus we see the important
function performed by the bacteria.</p>

<p>The so-called dis-ease germs may be found in the healthy
body, but that body does not have the dis-ease merely because
that germ is present. If, however, there is a subluxation which
interferes with the transmission of mental impulses the tissues
soon become pathological and proper environment is created
for the development of the germ. Then this germ propagates
and soon there is a large number present. These germs will,
however, disappear as soon as the tissues become normal.
In other words, when the incoördination is restored to coördination
the germs disappear.</p>


<h3>Source of Communication</h3>

<p>There are two recognized principal sources of communicable
dis-ease common to man, namely, man himself and
the lower animals. It is interesting to note that most of the
so-called communicable dis-eases are peculiar to man alone.
They are not found in the lower animals except as they are
communicated by man for experimental purposes. It is true
that domesticated animals are more susceptible to dis-ease
than wild animals.</p>

<p>From the standpoint of hygiene there must be a distinction
made between the source of infection and the media of
conveyance. Man and animals are considered the main sources
of infection. Environment is regarded a source of infection.
It is maintained that water, food, air, and soul form a media
for conveyance, but they are not considered sources of infection.
Rosenau, one of the leading hygienists, states that
“most of the microörganisms causing the communicable dis-eases
of man are frail and soon die in our environment, as
in the air, soil or water.” Notwithstanding this fact, some
still maintain that these frail little germs cause dis-ease.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span></p>


<h3>Modes of Transfer</h3>

<p>Hygienists assert that germs are transmitted either by
direct or indirect means. The vehicles of transmission may
be man himself, animals, or anything that will carry the germs
from one person to another. Price says, “The most frequent
and demonstrated mode of infection is by direct contact of
dis-ease with the healthy, of the persons surrounding the
infected one, such as physicians, nurses, etc.”</p>

<p>We must differentiate between the mode of transmission,
or, as it is sometimes called, the mode of infection, and the
channel of infection. The channel of infection is the passage
through which the germs enter the body. In tuberculosis the
channel of entrance might be the respiratory tract, through
the skin, or by means of the digestive tract, while the mode
of infection or mode of transfer might be by such means as
milk or sputum.</p>

<p>There are two principal modes of transference: (a) direct
or contact infection, (b) indirect infection. Under this second
heading would be included carriers or intermediate host.
Direct or contact infection is from person to person and may
be accomplished through discharges from the nose and mouth
or other excretions from the body. There are many dis-eases
supposed to be transferred from person to person by direct
contact. Such dis-ease as diphtheria, tuberculosis, scarlet
fever, syphilis, gonorrhea and skin dis-eases belong in this
class. It is also asserted that these same dis-eases may be
transmitted from person to person by intermediate agents.
For example, typhoid germs may be transmitted in fecal matter
into the water supply and ingested into the body. The
gonococci may be deposited upon fomites, such as bedding,
and transferred to other individuals. From a chiropractic
standpoint these incoördinations will be produced only when
there is interference with transmission of mental impulses, preventing
intellectual adaptation taking place in the body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span></p>

<p>Indirect infection is accomplished from person to person
through such means as water, food, air and soil. It is claimed
by medical hygienists that dis-eases may be transferred great
distances by these vehicles. However, some of the so-called
pathogenic germs are short lived and will therefore not infect
after any length of time.</p>

<p>It is affirmed by some that a person may be a carrier of
a dis-ease and not himself be suffering from the dis-ease. As,
for instance, there are cases on record where an individual has
been a carrier of diphtheria, having the germs in his own throat
and from his throat the germs have found their way into the
throats of others. In other words, there were pathogenic
germs in his body which were doing no harm to him, but when
they entered the body of others caused dis-ease. People have
been found with every imaginable dis-ease germ and yet have
themselves been perfectly well. Such persons are known as
“carriers.” From a chiropractic viewpoint this condition is
very easily explained. In such people the transmission of
mental impulses is sufficient to permit Innate Intelligence to
maintain a sufficient degree of adaptation to prevent the
propagation of the germs, but not sufficient to enable Innate
to excrete the germs as waste material.</p>

<p>The course followed in preventive medicine in these cases
is isolation of the individuals and the strictest sanitation.
Their occupations are controlled so that they will not handle
food intended for other people. In these ways danger from
carriers is lessened.</p>

<p>Pathogenic bacteria live in the bodies of infected persons,
in their secretions and excretions, and in the discharges of
the body, but they are not found free in Nature. The principal
vehicle of transmission is man himself. He is also the principal
recipient of infection. Germs may be found in the
various secretions such as those from the eye, ear, nose, throat,
from wounds and in the pus from abscesses; they may be
found also in sputum, urine and in the solid excretions. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
these ways they may be transmitted from one individual to
another. They may also be carried by animals, insects, food,
milk, water, air or any other mode or vehicle. The most
common mode of transference, however, is from person to
person.</p>


<h3>Channels of Entry</h3>

<p>The channels through which germs enter the body are
grouped as follows: (a) respiratory tract, (b) digestive tract,
(c) skin, (d) genito-urinary tract.</p>

<p>Since the air contains many germs at all times, it can
readily be seen that the respiratory tract forms an excellent
portal of entry through the mucous membrane of the eyes,
nose, mouth, throat and lungs. It is asserted by those who
believe that germs cause dis-ease, that the germs of diphtheria,
scarlatina, measles and pneumonia enter the body through the
respiratory tract. It can readily be seen that since the air
contains bacteria at all times, even of the so-called pathogenic
type, that they would be taken in with every breath and if
these germs were the cause of dis-ease every individual would
have all kinds of dis-ease. It is quite evident that these germs
do not remain in the body except under the most favorable
conditions, obtaining only when there is interference with
transmission which makes the tissues abnormal.</p>

<p>It is maintained by exponents of the germ theory that the
greater number of germ dis-eases are caused by the germs
that enter the body through the mouth into the alimentary
tract. There are many pathogenic and non-pathogenic germs
contained in the food that we eat and the water that we drink,
and yet these germs do not produce dis-ease in every individual,
yet the exponents of the germ theory hold that typhoid
fever, cholera, dysentery and many other dis-eases are transmitted
to the body through the alimentary canal by means of
food and water.</p>

<p>As a portal of entrance for germs into the body, the skin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
is considered of least importance since the germs will not
penetrate the normal skin under ordinary circumstances. If
there is an abrasion or wound infection may be produced by
the entrance of germs, but this will take place only when
there is sufficient interference with transmission of mental
impulses to make it impossible for Innate Intelligence to
bring about proper reparatory processes. Animal parasites
may find a portal of entrance through the skin.</p>

<p>The genito-urinary tract furnishes a portal of entrance
into the body for such germs as those of gonorrhea, syphilis
and tuberculosis, either by direct contact or through intermediary
agents. Infection of the body is by means of some
of these entry channels which differ with the different bacteria.
The bacteria may be entirely innocent when entering
one part of the body, yet when they enter through some other
portal they may be considered pathogenic. In other words,
some germs will thrive in one part of the body but not in some
other part.</p>


<h3>Terms Infectious and Contagious</h3>

<p>The terms infectious and contagious are not clearly defined
and have no scientific precision. “A contagious (contigere,
to touch) dis-ease is one that is readily communicable—in common
parlance, ‘catching.’ Formerly a contagious dis-ease was
considered as one which is caught from another by contact,
by the breath or by effluvia. A contagious dis-ease implies
direct or personal contact. If contagious dis-eases are limited
to those contracted by direct contact or touch, as the etymology
of the word signifies, only syphilis and dis-eases similarly
contracted would be contagious. As a matter of fact,
smallpox, measles and influenza are types of contagious dis-eases,
and the term is now usually understood.”</p>

<p>“An infectious (inficere, to put in, dip in, or mix in) dis-ease
is usually considered as one not conveyed directly and
obviously, as in the case of contagion, but indirectly through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
some hidden influence or medium. In the days when specific
febrile dis-eases were regarded as caused by miasmata and
noxious effluvia, the term ‘infectious’ and ‘miasmatic’ dis-eases
were more or less synonymous. Typhoid fever was
often taken as a type of an infectious dis-ease. Malaria was
the type of miasmatic dis-ease.” (Rosenau, <cite>Preventive Medicine
and Hygiene</cite>.)</p>

<p>Most authors consider that an infectious dis-ease may be
contagious and a contagious dis-ease is also infectious. Contagion
implies more of a personal contact as a mode of transfer,
while infection implies more of an indirect mode. The
communicable is more specific, but does not refer to any particular
mode of transference.</p>

<p>There are many so-called communicable dis-eases, yet let
it ever be remembered that if Innate Intelligence is operating
at par in the body there will be an immunity from these dis-eases,
although the germs that are supposed to cause them
will still exist.</p>

<h2>DEFINITIONS</h2>


<h3>Disinfection</h3>

<p>When an object is contaminated with so-called pathogenic
germs it is said to be infected. To disinfect an object it is
necessary to destroy the microörganisms. The destruction of
all so-called pathogenic germs, whether in the substance of
the object or on its surface, is called disinfection. All lower
forms of animal and vegetable life are destroyed in sterilization,
while in disinfection only the germs which, from the
medical standpoint, are the cause of dis-ease, are destroyed.
The agent used in disinfection is known as a disinfectant or
germicide.</p>


<h3>Sterilization</h3>

<p>The destruction of all germ life in or on an object is known
as sterilization. From the standpoint of hygiene sterilization
is unnecessary except in dis-eases such as anthrax, tetanus,
and other spore-bearing dis-eases, the spore being highly resistive
and not so easily destroyed as the vegetative cells.
Sterilization will disinfect but disinfection will not necessarily
sterilize. Disinfection is thoroughly efficient in almost all
cases. Sterilization destroys all life.</p>


<h3><b>Antiseptic</b> (Anti, against, and septos, putrid)</h3>

<p>An antiseptic prevents putrefaction but does not necessarily
destroy the microörganisms. A substance may act as
an antiseptic by delaying or preventing the processes of decay
and decomposition, but still not be a germicide. In other
words, anything that will hinder the development of germ life<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
acts as an antiseptic. Thus cold has a preservative action,
although it will not destroy the microörganisms. A disinfectant
may be diluted and used as an antiseptic. A 10% solution
of formalin is a good disinfectant and will kill bacteria
in a relatively short space of time, but formalin in a solution
of one to fifty thousand will be a very good antiseptic. The
germination of anthrax spores may be prevented by the use
of bichloride of mercury in as weak a solution as one to three
hundred thousand, but it will require a solution of one to one
thousand to destroy the spores. A disinfectant is also an
antiseptic but an antiseptic is not a disinfectant.</p>


<h3>Asepsis</h3>

<p>Asepsis is an absence of putrefactive bacteria. This may
be accomplished without the use of germicidal agents by
cleanliness which excludes all so-called pathogenic germs.</p>


<h3>Insecticide</h3>

<p>An insecticide is an agent capable of destroying insect
life. Many of the germicidal agents are also insecticides.
There is a great difference in the resistance of different insects.
Formaldehyde is a good germicide but is not an insecticide.
There are four ways of using insecticides. In liquid
form, powder, vapor form and those placed in food to be eaten
by the insects.</p>


<h3>Germicide</h3>

<p>A germicide and a disinfectant are the same for they both
destroy germ life. Many germicides are so powerful that they
completely sterilize or destroy all life.</p>


<h3>Deodorant</h3>

<p>A deodorant is not in any sense a disinfectant and has no
power to destroy germ life. It is an agent which neutralizes
unpleasant odors. A disinfectant destroys germs but does<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
not necessarily destroy odors. A deodorant must not be confused
with a substance having pungent odor which merely
substitutes one odor for another. A deodorant destroys the
unpleasant odor.</p>


<h3>Fumigation</h3>

<p>Fumigation is a means of disinfection by use of fumes or
gases, and is used generally for the purpose of destroying
germ life only on the surface of objects. For this reason
fumigation should not be used as a substitute for disinfection.
Formaldehyde and sulphur dioxide are used largely for fumigating
purposes.</p>

<p>Of these two gases formaldehyde is the better since it is
not poisonous, does not injure the surface of objects and will
not damage the most delicate fabrics nor destroy colors.
Sulphur dioxide is very destructive and therefore less desirable.
However, all the gaseous agents lack sufficient penetrative
power to accomplish more than a surface disinfection. Formaldehyde
is a good germicide and this adds to its efficiency.</p>

<p>To obtain the desired results in fumigating there must be
special attention given the preparation of the rooms or spaces
to be fumigated. All objects in the room should be so exposed
that the gas may readily get to all surfaces. All furniture and
other objects should be moved into the room away from the
walls and all doors and drawers of bureaus and boxes should
be opened so the gas may find free access to every nook and
corner. Much of the gas may escape through cracks and
crevices, therefore special care must be exercised that these
openings are all properly closed before the fumigation is
started. In view of the fact that the gas is non-destructive
there is no harm done even to the most delicate materials.</p>

<p>The best results are obtained from the formaldehyde when
the temperature of the room is 65° F. or over, with a relative
humidity of at least 60%. While formaldehyde has the power<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
to kill spores it is not considered sufficient to disinfect in such
dis-eases as anthrax and tetanus.</p>

<p>Formaldehyde gas kills all forms of microörganisms almost
instantly but is not particularly destructive to higher form of
life. It produces a marked irritation in the mucous membrane
of the respiratory tract which may result in death to animals
exposed to the gas for any length of time. It is not considered
an insecticide.</p>

<p>In fumigating a room with formaldehyde great care must
be exercised that the individual does not remain in the room
after the gas begins to be liberated. After the process of
fumigation has been completed the windows and doors should
all be opened that the gas may escape. It is always best to
have the doors and windows open from the outside so that it
will not be necessary for any one to go into the room until
the gas has blown out.</p>


<h2>AGENTS OF DISINFECTION</h2>


<h3>Physical Agents</h3>

<p>The physical agents of disinfection are sunlight, electricity,
pressure, dry heat, burning, boiling, and steam.</p>


<h3>Chemical Agents</h3>

<p>Chemical agents of disinfection are divided into two divisions—gaseous
and liquid disinfectants. The gaseous disinfectants
are: formaldehyde gas, sulphur dioxide gas, hydrocyanic
acid gas, chlorin, oxygen, and oxone.</p>

<p>Some of the most important liquid disinfectants are metallic
salts, bichloride of mercury, silver and zinc salts, coal-tar
creosote, carbolic acid, phenol, lysol, creolin and formalin.</p>


<h2>MEANS OF DISINFECTION</h2>


<h3>Natural Means</h3>

<p>Nature’s means of disinfecting are by dilution, sunlight,
desiccation, time and antibiosis. The direct rays of the sun are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
Nature’s greatest germicide. Few of the microörganisms will
live in the direct rays, but there are none that will withstand
them for more than a few hours. Germs can not withstand
the effect of dryness. Thus we see there is in Nature that
which works as a most efficient germicide. The combination
of sunlight and dryness forms a most desirable means of disinfection.
When germs become attenuated through the effects
of these natural processes they do little harm when introduced
into the body.</p>

<p>One of the most important adjuncts to the work of disinfection
is personal cleanliness and sanitation of the environment.</p>


<h3>Other Agents</h3>

<p><b>Fire</b> is not a practical disinfectant. It can be used only
with those articles that are of little or no value since the
article that is being disinfected is destroyed. The burning of
all refuse and garbage is by all means the best method. Burning
is the most satisfactory and cheapest method in disinfecting
sputum and other excreta from the body, and in disposing
of articles of little value saturated or contaminated
with such.</p>

<p>The <b>dry heat</b> method of disinfecting requires specially built
apparatus such as dry air sterilizers. This form is not practicable
for use in disinfecting fabrics and other materials that
are destroyed or injured by extremely high temperature required
to destroy the germ life. Metals are easily injured by
this method as they are likely to be scorched. All forms of
life are destroyed in an hour’s time when exposed to a temperature
of 150° C. Such articles as glassware will withstand
this heat or even higher and may be thoroughly sterilized
in from one to two hours. This insures proper penetration
and sufficient heat to completely destroy all life.</p>

<p><b>Boiling</b> is one of the most satisfactory and easiest methods
of disinfecting. Continuous boiling for an hour in water at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
100° C. will result in the destruction of most germs of the
so-called infectious dis-eases. There are some of the spores,
such as those of anthrax and tetanus, that will survive the
most strenuous processes of boiling. However, most of
the germs will be destroyed before the boiling point is
reached.</p>

<p>Boiling is the best method to be used in disinfecting bedding,
body linen, towels and other fabrics which will not be
harmed by this process. There is a great variety of articles
that may be disinfected in this way, such as utensils and bed
pans. The surfaces of the floors, walls, beds, and other objects
may be cleansed with boiling water. In this use it is advisable
to add some disinfectant to the water.</p>

<p><b>Steam</b> is not only a disinfectant but it is also a sterilizing
agent. All forms of germ life, including spores, are completely
destroyed. It is therefore our best known disinfectant.
There are many objects that are injured and some ruined by
steam, such as silk, wool, furs, oilcloth and rubber goods, and
articles containing varnish or glue. There is danger from
staining and running of colors. Disinfection may be either
with streaming steam or with steam under pressure. For the
use of streaming steam no particular device is necessary.
Some means of providing the steam and some place to hang
or place the objects and articles to be disinfected are the two
essentials for this method. It is not necessary to have an air-tight
place. To use steam under pressure there must be a
specially constructed apparatus. There are many such devices
on the market and they are used in institutions where it is
found necessary to disinfect with steam.</p>

<p>Sterilization may be accomplished in twenty minutes with
steam at about one atmosphere of pressure which will give a
temperature of about 120° C. A temperature of about 125° C.
is obtained with the pressure at about twenty pounds to the
square inch. This reduces the time for sterilization to about
fifteen minutes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span></p>


<h3>Other Disinfectants</h3>

<p>Carbolic acid which is a good antiseptic but a comparatively
mild germicide is another disinfectant. It has very little
penetrating power and is of most value in a 3% to 5% solution
for washing floors, walls and woodwork. The cresoles are
more powerful and effective disinfectant than carbolic acid.
The most common of this group are: creoline, lysol, and saprol.
Their use is about the same as that of carbolic acid. Bichloride
of mercury may be used in a solution of from one to two thousand,
to one to five hundred and forms a very good disinfectant.
It kills germs but corrosive sublimate will kill spore-bearing
bacteria only in a solution of one to five hundred. In
weaker solutions it forms a very good antiseptic. Lime forms
a very good disinfectant, especially for excreta, cesspools and
cellars.</p>

<p class="center no-indent fs120 bold">HYGIENE AND SANITATION IN THE
SICK ROOM</p>


<h3>Factors in Normal Expression of Life</h3>

<p>In case of incoördination in the body there are always
existing conditions which require educated adaptation. It is
the study of these conditions to which the sickroom hygiene
and sanitation must be directed.</p>

<p>We will first consider the environment necessary for the
normal expression of life in the body. Unhindered transmission
of mental impulses alone will not give us the processes
of metabolism. To have normal metabolism in the body
oxygen must be carried to the tissue cells and there must be
an uninterrupted transmission of mental impulses. Nutrition
is derived from the food taken into the body and oxygen from
the air is breathed into the lungs. The mental impulses are
transformed in the brain by Innate Intelligence and transmitted
by efferent nerves; hence the necessity for a proper
amount of food, a sufficient supply of pure air and unhindered
transmission. But the nutrient elements contained in the food
are not in a state to be utilized by the tissue cells when taken
into the body; therefore it is necessary that the food be broken
up by the process of digestion that it will be rendered usable
by the tissue cells.</p>

<p>This process of digestion requires a great expenditure of
internal energy or, in other words, a functional activity of the
mental impulses. Thus it is seen that the body as a machine
must be supplied with the material necessary to keep it in
repair and running order, and that this material is taken in
and prepared within the body for bodily use.</p>

<p>Not only must provision be made for supplying the body<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
with the proper amount of food, but attention must be given
to a proper supply of oxygen for the lungs. This seems a
very simple thing to do, and it is simple under natural conditions,
but when we consider the unnatural conditions that
have been created by man and under which the human race
in civilized countries is living, it becomes a problem that requires
great engineering skill. The ventilation of great buildings,
streets and subways is no small problem and yet if the
processes of metabolism are to be maintained in the body
ventilation must be given attention.</p>


<h3>Importance of Environment</h3>

<p>If these internal processes are to be maintained there must
also be a certain environmental condition which will enable
Innate Intelligence to bring them about. The temperature,
humidity, and atmospheric pressure are all important in their
proper relationship. Innate Intelligence is capable of adapting
the body to extremes in these different environmental conditions,
but the transition from one degree to another, such as
temperature, must take place gradually to allow sufficient time
for the adaptative changes.</p>

<p>It will be observed that these changes take place more or
less gradually in Nature, but man is inclined to pass from one
extreme into another without thought of time needed for
adaptation. For example he passes from a highly heated room
into one with a very low temperature, or comes from compressed
air chambers, where the air pressure is greater than
the normal, into the normal atmospheric pressure without
sufficient precaution to the sudden change. These sudden
changes not only draw very heavily upon the adaptative forces
of the body, but actually interfere with the normal functional
activity of Innate Intelligence and produce subluxations. The
more natural the environment, the less energy will be required
to bring about adaptation and maintain the equilibrium of the
functions. Even though the environment is perfect, there must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
be a current of mental impulses sufficient to produce adaptative
action. When there is an interference with the transmission
of mental impulses to such an extent that this adaptation can
not take place there will be lack of function.</p>

<p>An environmental condition that will require as little
adaptative energy as possible should be maintained. There
should, therefore, be some attention given to the sick room,
not that the hygienic and sanitary measures will in any sense
cure the dis-ease, but that the forces in the body may not be
used up and dissipated because of an environment that requires
an abundance of force for adaptation.</p>

<p>The patient’s weakness in many incoördinations is purely
adaptative on the part of Innate Intelligence to prevent the
patient from continuing at work or doing other things that
would require an expenditure of the adaptative energies of
the body. In other words, it is for the purpose of conserving
the energies that are needed in the reparatory and
restorative processes necessary to bring about coördination.</p>

<p>For the above reason it is necessary to give attention to
the sick room in maintaining a condition to which Innate may
easily bring about intellectual adaptation and not draw upon
the reserve carrying capacity of the nerves.</p>


<h3>Function of the Educated Mind</h3>

<p>The expression of Innate Intelligence through the educated
brain has functions to perform that are quite as essential and
important in their way as are the functions produced by the
expression of Innate Intelligence through the innate brain.
Here is an illustration of what is meant: Innate Intelligence
sends mental impulses to the liver and produces bile independent
of educated brain. But if a man is walking across the
street and falls to the ground unconscious he will be mutilated
by traffic unless some one picks him up and protects him.
Innate is still in the body of the unconscious man, but is not
being expressed through the educated brain. The Innate is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
powerless to protect that body from harm—it requires the
expression of an Innate Intelligence through the educated
brain of some other person to bring about an adaptation to
circumstances and protect the unconscious man. In this
case the educated mind of one individual is substituted for
that of the other and the desired end is accomplished. This
educated function could not be expressed in the unconscious
man because of the inability of Innate Intelligence to be functioning
through the educated brain.</p>

<p>The functions of the educated mind as pertaining to the
expression of life in the body have to do mostly with the
environment. It is, therefore, within the scope of Chiropractic
to study the environmental conditions in order that the best
interests of Innate Intelligence in the expression of life in the
body be protected.</p>


<h3>Need for Conserving Energy</h3>

<p>Reference has already been made to the fact that adaptation
to environment requires an expenditure of energy in case
of incoördination. When an individual is sick there is need
for conservation of energy to the fullest degree. At this time
there must be no unnecessary drain upon the body in order
that all forces may be centered upon the one thing—restoration.
This leads us to a consideration of removing every
unnecessary demand upon Innate for expenditure of energy
so that all the forces may be utilized in the process of restoration.</p>

<p>There are a number of points to be considered in the care
of the sick room where the patient is confined to his bed.
There should be an even temperature maintained at all times
and great care taken that the room is never overheated. The
degrees at which temperature is to be maintained will be
governed somewhat by the character of the incoördination. In
conditions involving the respiratory tract the room may be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
kept quite cold. The temperature of the sick room may vary
from 50° F. to 70° F. according to the incoördination.</p>

<p>One of the most important features in the sick room is
proper ventilation and the elimination of dust and odors. The
patient at all times should be provided with an abundant
supply of pure air free from dust and other impurities. The
room should be so ventilated as to eliminate objectionable
drafts. This may be accomplished by placing screens in front
of open windows or stretching a gauze over the opening in
the window which will admit the air but not rapid enough
to produce a draft.</p>

<p>In some cases of incoördinations involving the eyes it is
advisable to maintain a subdued light in the room. This may
be obtained during the day by drawing the shade part way
down and during the night by placing shades over the lamps
or electric lights. If the eyes are very sensitive to light an
unnecessary adaptation may thus be avoided, thus enabling
Innate to use her forces in a more desirable way.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="image221" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image221.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent"><em>Changing Sheets.</em></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In severe cases some attention should be given to the furniture
and hangings, not so much because of any special
benefit to the patient, but for the convenience of the attendants
and to insure a better sanitary condition by eliminating everything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
that would tend to catch dust and dirt and matter given
off into the breathing zone.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="image222" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image222.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent"><em>Lifting Patient with
Draw Sheet.</em></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The bed and bedding should be kept clean and fresh. The
patient should be placed between sheets and not between
blankets even in the winter time. The top cover on the bed
should be white or of a light color. All soiled linen should
be removed immediately and the pillows should be kept well
aired. If the patient is weak, or for other reasons must be
handled by attendants, a draw sheet will be a great convenience;
a sheet may be folded about three times for this
purpose and placed under the patient’s hips on top of the
bed sheet. This may be used to turn the patient, move the
patient from one side of the bed to the other, or it may be
found of service in placing him on the adjusting bench. This
draw sheet may be left under the patient without discomfort.
At all times care should be exercised that the sheet, draw sheet
and covers are kept free from wrinkles. The bed clothes
should be changed in such a way as to disturb the patient
as little as possible. One-half of the bed should be changed
at a time and the patient moved over on the clean sheet with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
the aid of the draw sheet. It is not expected that the chiropractor
will find it necessary to do all these things himself;
indeed, if the patient is ill enough to require this kind of care
there should be a nurse on the case. However, even though
he is not going to do these things himself, he certainly ought
to know how they should be done.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent"><em>Draw Sheet in position

</figure>

<p>If the patient is forced to use a bed pan, great care should
be exercised that the bed clothes and clothing of the patient
are not soiled. If they are they should be immediately changed
or at least as soon as practicable. The disposal of the excreta
is of vital importance. It should be removed from the sick
room immediately. From a hygienic standpoint the fecal
matter, urine and sputum should be disinfected with a 10%
solution of formalin and allowed to stand for an hour, or by
adding bichloride to make a solution of one to one thousand.
The fecal matter should be placed in a receptacle and enough
hot water added to cover it, then a cup of unslacked lime added
and this allowed to stand covered for a couple of hours before
throwing into the sewer.</p>

<p>The patient confined to the bed should receive proper care.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
His hands and face should be bathed and he should be given
a sponge bath. This may be done without disturbing the
patient materially and may add greatly to his comfort. If
the incoördination is in the fever family there will be no
danger of the patient taking cold, but if it is not a febrile
dis-ease, great care must be taken to prevent this complication.
Everything possible should be done to add to the comfort
of the patient and to create a pleasant and cheerful atmosphere
about the sick room.</p>

<h3>Hygienic Measures Used in So-called Communicable
Dis-eases</h3>

<p>In discussing hygienic measures to be used in so-called
communicable dis-eases, it must be understood that these
measures are in no sense considered to be curative. If subluxations
were adjusted as soon as produced there would be
no occasion for such considerations, for man would remain
immune and there would be no communicable dis-eases. Since<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
subluxations are not always adjusted as soon as produced,
but remain and become chronic and dis-ease is allowed to
gather great momentum before adjustments are given, it becomes
necessary to bring about an adaptation educationally
to the incoördination. During the course of the dis-ease certain
hygienic measures should be used in order to maintain
a proper environmental condition.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="image225" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image225.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent"><em>Patient adjusted and
ready to be lifted to the
bed with draw-sheet</em>.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The so-called communicable dis-eases are quarantinable
and should be reported to the proper health authorities in
the states requiring such procedure, in compliance with the
law. There are certain sanitary and hygienic measures that
should be used from a standpoint of pure cleanliness and common
decency. The hygienic measures ordinarily recommended
may be summed up as follows: The stools, urine, sputum and
other excretions should be thoroughly disinfected. The urine
may be disinfected by adding bichloride to make a solution
of one to one thousand or by adding 10% formalin and allowing
the solution to stand for an hour or so. It is more difficult
to disinfect fecal matter. The masses should be thoroughly
broken up and disinfected with bleaching powder, 3%. A 5%<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
solution of carbolic acid may be used or formalin 10%. Another
easy and effective way is to add enough hot water to
cover the entire stool and then add a cup of unslacked lime
or about one-fourth as much lime as bulk. The receptacle
should then be covered and allow to stand for a couple of
hours. In this way there will be enough heat generated by
the lime to destroy the microörganisms. The sputum should
be burned.</p>

<p>It is recommended that the bed linen, towels and handkerchiefs
used by the patient be disinfected by immersing for at
least an hour in a solution of bichloride of mercury, one to one
thousand, a 5% solution of carbolic acid, or 10% solution of
formalin.</p>


<h3>Chiropractic Cause of So-called Communicable
Dis-eases</h3>

<p>Chiropractically the cause of the so-called communicable
dis-eases is interference with the transmission of mental impulses,
which results in lack of function. Where there is an
interference with the functions resulting in abnormal metabolism
there is always an accumulation of waste products and
poisons. The accumulation of the waste products and the
correspondingly lowered resistance in these structures provide
a fertile field for the growth and development of the bacteria
that are found in the particular incoördination. These germs
are present as scavengers for the sole purpose of consuming
the waste material and these bacteria will disappear as soon
as the subluxated vertebrae are adjusted and the tissues become
normal, for they can not live on normal tissue and will be
excreted as waste. However, if there are subluxations which
interfere with the transmission of mental impulses resulting
in lack of functions in the body and microörganisms are
allowed to enter the body, the abnormal tissues will furnish
them with food and a proper culture medium in which to
develop. From a chiropractic standpoint the best prophylaxis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
is adjustments to restore transmission to normal and the germs
will find no food or fertile field in which to develop and will
be excreted as so much material that can not be used in the
metabolism of the body.</p>

<p>Under chiropractic adjustments the incoördination (so-called
contagious dis-ease) will not run its full course; as a
matter of fact, the recovery may be so rapid that the patient
will be sick only a very few days. Under adjustments there
will be no complications or sequelæ and for this reason there
is not the necessity for hygienic measures to the same extent
as under ordinary treatment, but during the time the patient
is sick hygienic measures should be observed.</p>

<p class="center no-indent fs150 bold">FOOD</p>


<h2>GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS</h2>


<h3>Necessity for Food</h3>

<p>Food is defined as nutritive material absorbed or taken
into the body of an organism for purposes of growth or repair
and for the maintenance of the vital processes. Food is derived
from two sources—the animal kingdom and the vegetable
kingdom.</p>

<p>The body is composed of materials which are constantly
wearing out under the processes carried on in the functioning
of the body, and this tissue must be replaced with new material.
This is supplied in the form of food that is taken into
the system and acted upon by the secretions in such a way
as to break up and properly combine the chemicals so that
Innate Intelligence may bring about an assimilation in the
tissue cells.</p>

<p>The variety of articles that Innate can use as food in
the body is varied. It is not necessary to have a perfect
food or a perfectly rationed diet in order for Innate to maintain
the anabolism of the body. The ease with which the
processes of digestion are carried on depends upon the freedom
with which mental impulses are transmitted to the organs
of digestion.</p>

<p>As there is a constant flow of mental impulses through the
nerves and a constant expression in the tissue cells so there is
a corresponding change taking place in the tissues of the body.
To this change there must be a constant adaptation so that
new tissue will be provided to replace that which is worn out.
To accomplish this there must be a proper supply of nutrition
at properly stated intervals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span></p>

<p>It is not the purpose of chiropractic hygiene to say what
a person should or should not eat. Innate Intelligence is the
best judge as to that. Chiropractic philosophy teaches that
a person may eat anything that does not disagree with him;
or to put it otherwise, a person should eat what agrees with
him. It also teaches us that pain and discomfort from eating
that which does not digest is Innate telling the educated mind
that this particular article is not being digested and that he
should not eat it. This lack of digestion is not the fault of
the food, but is due to an interference with transmission which
prevents Innate from bringing about an adaptation to this
food. In other words, the interference with transmission prevents
Innate from producing the secretion that is needed in
the digestion of this particular article or diet.</p>


<h3>Distinction between Appetite and Hunger</h3>

<p>It is quite necessary that we make a distinction between
appetite and hunger. Hunger is Innate calling for food. It is
the expression through the educated brain of the vibratory
interpretations which are received from the tissue cells that
are in need of nutrition. These vibrations are interpreted by
Innate Intelligence and Innate becomes aware of the need
of the tissue cell. Thereupon she expresses this interpretation
through the educated brain and we become aware, educationally,
of this condition which is interpreted as hunger.</p>

<p>Hunger is an Innate interpretation while appetite is an
educated interpretation. Hunger is a desire for food while
appetite is a desire for a certain kind of food. The appetite
decides what kind of food we will eat to satisfy the hunger.
Appetite may be perverted.</p>

<p>When there is a condition which interferes with the process
of digestion Innate Intelligence takes away the desire for
food. When this is true there should be no effort on the part
of the educated man to tempt the appetite. If the appetite
is tempted in such a case, the food will not be properly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
digested, or if it is, it will be necessary for Innate to employ
force that should be used for some other purpose.</p>

<p>If the processes of digestion are normal the individual may
eat any article of food and it will be properly digested and he
will not be conscious of this process. But if the process of
digestion is abnormal he may not be able to digest even the
most scientific diet. The severity of the indigestion will depend
upon the degree of interference with function. In such
event appetite is not reliable because it may call for something
that can not be digested. Innate knows nothing of the
different foods. She calls for nutrition, but the educated mind
says beefsteak and eggs. Now if we become sick after eating
beefsteak and eggs this is Innate trying to let us know that
the food is not being digested and should not be taken into
the stomach.</p>

<p>On the other hand we may find that Innate will revolt
when we try to eat food which can not be digested. Innate
will cause us to lose our desire to eat such food, the very
thoughts of it being repulsive.</p>

<p>Chiropractic philosophy maintains that a patient should
eat anything that agrees with him and that Innate is the best
judge. A food is anything that can be used in the metabolism
of the body. A poison is anything that can not be used in the
metabolism of the body and if allowed to remain in the body
will injure the tissues. That which is food for one may therefore
be poison for another.</p>

<p>If there was no interference with the transmission preventing
the normal expression of Innate Intelligence through
the educated brain, we would eat only those things which
could be digested. It might be said that Innate is a great
dietitian and one that would never make a mistake if there
could always be a perfect expression. The trouble is that we
substitute educated for Innate and therefore make mistakes
and eat those things which can not be digested because of
interference with transmission of mental impulses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span></p>

<p>The amount of food and the kind required by man will be
governed largely by the character of the work he does. The
state of health, the climate and season, occupation, clothing,
exercise, body weight, sex and age all have an influence on
the quantity of food required to maintain bodily health.</p>

<p>The appetite could be relied upon to determine just the
quantity and quality of our diet were it not for the fact that,
in this day of civilization when cooking is a fine art and the
appetite is so stimulated, we eat beyond the normal requirements
of the body. As a result the stomach is overloaded
with food that is not required for the normal health
and vigor of the individual. The digestive organs are overworked.
There is an engorgement of the liver, and degenerative
changes, such as fatty heart, take place.</p>

<p>The symptoms of overeating are: headache, feeling of
lassitude, drowsiness, mental stupor, the liver becomes congested,
the intestines are engorged, the secretions of the body
are altered in their composition, the urine is heavily loaded
with salts, there is constipation, maybe biliousness, and the
tongue is heavily coated. There may also be obesity and gout.</p>


<h3>Starvation</h3>

<p>Food must be taken into the body in sufficient quantity
and quality so that bodily function may be maintained. The
term starvation is a technical one meaning a lack of sufficient
food, although it is used loosely to mean a condition resulting
from lack of assimilation. After the food in the stomach has
been completely digested and the process of assimilation has
reached a certain stage, vibrations are carried from the tissue
cells to the brain. These enable the intelligence to know in
what stage of assimilation the food is, and these vibrations
are interpreted as hunger, the sensation being localized in the
stomach. In the normal individual this sensation will appear
soon enough to enable the introduction of food into the
stomach so that its digestion may be completed before any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
injury from lack of nutrition occurs to the tissues. In other
words, a provision has been made whereby food will be called
for in sufficient time to enable Innate Intelligence to prepare
this food for the tissue cells, so that there will be a new supply
as soon as the process of assimilation has been completed.
If food is not taken into the stomach when the sensation of
hunger is manifested this sensation in the course of time will
result in extreme bodily weakness and faintness. In certain
incoördinations sensations may be produced which will be
interpreted by the educated mind as hunger. Therefore, it is
necessary to make a distinction between the sensations of
hunger and the sensations from incoördinations of the stomach.
In a dyspeptic condition there is an almost constant sensation
of hunger, and the individual may eat much more food than
can be digested. Very often, in these cases, the food is taken
into the stomach so rapidly that there is not sufficient time
for the gastric secretions to act upon it. In this way much
more food may be taken into the stomach than is actually
required by the tissue cells. It is obvious that we must have
a proper amount of food in balanced rations, and also that
this food be properly digested in order to be assimilated by
the tissues. If food is not properly digested it can not be
assimilated.</p>


<h3>Inanition</h3>

<p>There may be a condition obtained in the body resulting
from a lack of assimilation of food by the tissues, even though
there is a sufficient amount of food taken into the body. This
condition is known technically as inanition. Death will result
in a short time when food is completely withheld whether the
condition is that of starvation or inanition. There may be an
interference with transmission of mental impulses to the digestive
organs. This will interfere with digestion, and inanition
will result because the food which is not properly digested
can not be assimilated even though the tissue cells are perfectly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
normal. Inanition may also result from an interference
with transmission, which prevents the tissue cells from performing
their normal function in the process of assimilation.
In this way the tissues starve for the want of food, not because
there is a lack of nutrition in the body, but because the food
taken into the system has not been properly broken down by
the digestive secretions, or if it has been properly digested
it has not been assimilated. It is a recognized fact that a large
percentage of growing children are underweight. Authors
differ as to the percentage. It ranges all the way from 15%
to 60%. This condition is not necessarily caused by an insufficient
amount of proper food, for the condition has been
found more prevalent among the children of the wealthy
than among those of the poorer classes. This shows that the
cause for such malnutrition is within the child and not in the
food that he is eating. In the large majority of cases it is
either because the food is not being properly digested or is not
being assimilated after it has been digested. It is quite necessary
that there be a properly balanced diet, but even a perfectly
balanced diet will not guarantee perfect assimilation.
This can be accomplished only through unhindered transmission
and expression of mental impulses in all parts of the
body.</p>


<h3>Balanced Rations</h3>

<p>Properly balanced rations will enable Innate Intelligence
to promote the growth and maintain the processes of the
body with the greatest ease and the least necessity for the
adaptative expenditure of internal energy. Much attention
has been given the science of nutrition. At one time there
was great importance attached to the chemical composition of
foods, special attention being given to the proteins, carbohydrates
and fats contained in the diet. Later it was thought
that certain inorganic salts were necessary. Great stress has
been placed upon the caloric value of food. The latest students<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
in the science of nutrition have emphasized the value of
vitamins.</p>

<p>A properly balanced diet should contain sufficient calories
and inorganic salts, especially iron, phosphorus, calcium and
iodin. There should be a sufficient variety of foods to provide
the necessary vitamins. It is also thought that a certain
amount of roughage is necessary. If we expect the best results
from our digestive tract we should strive to keep the balance
approximately the same each day. This is not because Innate
Intelligence is unable to adapt the body to a great variety of
food, but it is more to prevent a necessity for such extreme
adaptation. To illustrate: If we constantly introduce too
much acid into the stomach, it necessitates an adaptative action
on the part of Innate Intelligence in the production of an
alkali to neutralize the acid. Since we know so little educationally
about nutrition, it is wise for us to eat as great a
variety of foods as possible, and especially is this necessary
in providing a balanced ration for growing children.</p>

<p>In considering food we must not forget the importance
of proper digestion and assimilation. In Chiropractic the diet
is of little importance, providing the functional activities of
the body are maintained at normality.</p>


<h2>CLASSIFICATION OF FOODS</h2>


<h3>Sources of Food</h3>

<p>Foods are classified according to source, chemical composition,
physical properties and function.</p>

<p>In classifying food as to its source we have three classifications:
animal, plant and mineral. Meat, fowl, fish, shell-fish,
eggs, milk and its products, animal fat and gelatin help to
constitute the animal foods. Seeds, roots, leaves, cereals,
vegetables, fruits, sugar and vegetable oils are plant foods.
From the mineral there are: iron, potassium, phosphorus,
iodin, sulphur. These are obtained from the animal and plant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
foods. Water is not classed as a food, but it enters into the
diet as a very important constituent.</p>


<h3>Chemical Composition</h3>

<p>From the standpoint of chemical composition foods are
grouped into two classes, nitrogenous and non-nitrogenous.
Both the animal and vegetable kingdom contribute foods to
each of these classes, although the animal substances belong
more to the nitrogenous, while the vegetable kingdom belongs
more particularly to the non-nitrogenous foods. The nitrogenous
foods consist chiefly of carbon, oxygen, hydrogen and
nitrogen and are considered to be essentially tissue builders.
Hygienists speak of the non-nitrogenous foods as being force
producers, asserting that these foods supply energy for muscular
action.</p>


<h3>Physical Properties</h3>

<p>Under this heading foods are classified as: (a) solids, semi-solids
and liquid foods; (b) fibrous, gelatinous, starchy, oleaginous,
crystalline and albuminous foods. The indigestible
residue is called roughage.</p>


<h3>Function</h3>

<p>Foods are classified as: Proteins, carbohydrates, fats, condiments,
inorganic salts and vitamins.</p>

<p><b>Proteins</b> are the tissue builders of the body. They are
derived from meat, milk, eggs, peas and beans for example.
Some foods are much richer in protein than others, and there
is also a difference in the quality of the protein. Some protein
is more valuable from the standpoint of food than others.
Casein is very rich in protein which is of great food value.
The protein found in meat is also of good quality, but it is
not as valuable as that found in milk. Such cellular organs as
the liver and pancreas furnish a good source of protein. There
is a very small amount of protein of excellent quality found
in leafy plants. There is a difference of opinion among authors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
as to the amount of protein needed per day by healthy individuals.
Some advise a very small amount of protein while
others recommend a diet containing as much as 125 grams,
approximately four and one-half ounces, per day.</p>

<p>The <b>carbohydrates</b> furnish the body with the necessary
material for forming adipose tissue and heat through oxidation.
It is very essential that the body be provided with sufficient
starches. This is evidenced by the fact that starch
constituents are so universally found in food from whatever
source taken. For example, carbohydrates or starchy foods
are found in cereals, tubers, such as potatoes, and sugars of
cane, beets and fruits, and glycogen in flesh.</p>

<p><b>Fats</b> come from animal and vegetable sources and are represented
by butter, fats of meat, olive oil, cottonseed oil,
nuts and seeds. Oily substances are found in practically all
vegetables. A vitamin known as fat soluble A is found
in certain fats, but not in others. It is found in the fat of
milk and usually in other fats of animal origin; and also in
eggs and in leafy plants. Lard and oil of plant origin furnish
very little of this vitamin. It can readily be seen by this that
all fats do not have the same food value.</p>

<p>The <b>condiments</b> are the spices such as pepper, mustard,
cloves, coffee, tea and alcoholic beverages.</p>

<p><b>Inorganic</b> salts are not ordinarily classed as a food. However,
it is essential in the maintaining of life. It performs a
very important function in the building of bone and assists
also in digestion and metabolism. The vegetable acids, such
as tartaric from grapes, lemon and citric, will be found in combination
with the bases calcium, sodium and potassium, for
example, especially when they are taken from fresh vegetables
and fruits. When absorbed they form carbonates and are
therefore indispensable in the process of metabolism, since
they aid in maintaining the alkalinity of the body. If the food
of the growing infant is deficient in calcium phosphate, or if
there is an interference with transmission which hinders the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
activity of calcium phosphate in the body, the bones of the
child will be poorly developed and will become abnormally
soft. In this case they yield under the weight of the body
and become deformed. A good illustration of this is seen in
rickets.</p>

<p>Milk forms an excellent source of calcium in large quantities
and in a utilizable form. The fact that milk is deficient
in iron must be taken into consideration when it is used as
a sole article of diet for growing children.</p>

<p>Vitamin is the name given to a chemical substance found
in yeast and in rice polishings. It was so named by Dr. Casimir
Funk, a Russian chemist, in 1913. The chemical nature
of the vitamin is unknown, but it has been proven that it
possesses great growth-producing qualities, a small amount
producing great results. Only three vitamins have been recognized.
One is soluble in fat and has been called fat soluble
A, the other two are soluble in water and are known as water
soluble B and water soluble C.</p>

<p>Fat soluble A is found in the leaves of plants, spinach,
carrots, peas, peanuts, but more abundantly in eggs, butter
and milk; it is also present in such glandular organs as the
liver and kidneys. Cod liver oil is found to contain this
vitamin. It is found to be almost, if not entirely, missing
from lard and the fats of vegetable origin; sugar from cane,
milk and beets, bolted flour, starch and glucose and polished
rice are entirely devoid of this vitamin, while the rice polishings
are exceedingly rich in fat soluble A.</p>

<p>Experiments have been made upon rats and dogs which
show that if they are fed upon a diet devoid of this vitamin
they develop a condition similar to rickets. Their eyes become
inflamed and dry and eventually blindness results.</p>

<p>The vitamin known as water soluble B is probably the
most widely distributed of the vitamins. It is obtained in
tubers, seeds, leaves of plants and in animals, but not in the
oils or fats of either vegetable or animal origin. This vitamin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
promotes growth. The prolonged absence of it induces beriberi.
Water soluble B is not destroyed by boiling the foods
in which it is found. This vitamin is found in yeast, navy
and soy beans, milk, parsnips, potatoes, spinach, whole grain,
rice, maize, carrots, onions, oats, cauliflower, celery, rutabagas
and whole wheat bread. This vitamin is present in very small
quantities in such foods as cabbage, tomatoes, peas, eggs and
wheat bran. All ordinary foods contain this vitamin. Water
soluble B is known as the antineurotic vitamin.</p>

<p>The water soluble C vitamin is known as the antiscorbutic
vitamin. In experimentations it has been found that animals
entirely deprived of this vitamin have developed scurvy. The
condition disappeared when the vitamin was included in the
diet.</p>

<p>The experiments by which it has been hoped to associate
many dis-eases with vitamins have not proven satisfactory,
and while it is a recognized fact that they play an important
part in the bodily metabolism yet dis-ease can not be corrected
by a scientific endeavor to supply the needed vitamins through
diet.</p>

<p>Water soluble C is found in such foods as: apples, cabbage,
tomatoes, spinach, peas, onions, lettuce, oranges, potatoes
and milk.</p>

<p class="center no-indent fs150 bold">FOOD POISONS</p>


<h3>Sources</h3>

<p>In most instances such poisoning comes from food that is
preserved in some way. Very seldom do we find this poisoning
in fresh foods. Such prepared foods as chopped meats,
sausage, meat pies and salads, for example furnish the best
sources for this poisoning. The formation period of the poison
usually covers from eight to twenty-eight hours. There are
two classes of food poisoning: first, food infection; second,
food intoxication. Clinically, there is a great difference between
them. Food infection is an acute condition in which
there is nausea, vomiting, cramps, diarrhœa and fever. Food
intoxication is a febrile condition characterized by nervous
symptoms, paralysis and constipation.</p>

<p>In food infection the mortality is seldom above 1%, while
in food intoxication it runs from 50% upward. The condition
resulting from food intoxication is known as botulism. The
statistics which are available on food poisoning would indicate
that it is not very prevalent and the number of persons involved
in outbreaks is comparatively small.</p>

<p>Many conditions in which there are gastro-intestinal symptoms
might be mistaken for food poisoning. Such symptoms
as nausea, cramps, vomiting or diarrhœa may be due to acute
gastric indigestion, and may not be in any way associated
with food poisoning.</p>

<p>Foods containing such poison should be thoroughly cooked
so that the heat may penetrate to the very center. A temperature
of 70° C. is sufficient to render the food free of
the poison.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span></p>


<h3>Food Infection</h3>

<p>The incubation period of food infection is usually from
six to twelve hours from the time the food is taken into the
stomach until the manifestation of symptoms. This period
may in some cases be reduced to only four hours, while in
others it may be extended to seventy-two or more hours. This
class of food poisoning is sometimes called meat poisoning
from the fact that meat forms its chief vehicle, but milk and
milk products and even vegetables may contain it.</p>

<p>The <b>symptoms</b> are characterized by acute gastro-intestinal
disturbances. The onset is usually sudden. The first to appear
are severe griping pains in the abdominal region, there may
be various nervous manifestations, such as drowsiness, muscular
twitchings and more or less restlessness. The abdominal
pains may be accompanied with diarrhœa, nausea and vomiting.
There may be chills and headache. As the condition
progresses the stools become a greenish color and of a very
watery consistency. There may be chills and headaches,
marked muscular weakness, faintness and possibly prostration.
The temperature runs from 102° F. to 103° F. There is excessive
thirst, skin eruptions and herpes. There is often oliguria.
The severity of the symptoms will depend upon the amount
of poison taken into the system and the freedom of transmission
of mental impulses, which will enable Innate Intelligence
to bring about her adaptative processes. Usually the attack
lasts only a few days, although the fulminating cases may
prove fatal within twenty-four hours. Warm weather seems
to be conducive to the formation of this poison, since the
greater number of outbreaks occur in the summer time.</p>


<h3>Food Intoxication</h3>

<p>This form of food poisoning is called botulism. The poison
which forms is the specific toxin produced by the activity of
the bacillus botulinus. The botulis itself lives on decayed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
organic matter, therefore it is of the saprophyte type. This
poison is found in a great many different foods of both plant
and animal origin. The intoxication in botulism affects the
central nervous system. It is a febrile condition and there
are no gastro-intestinal disturbances. Usually the symptoms
in botulism will appear from eighteen to thirty-six hours after
the poison has been taken into the stomach. There are cases
on record in which the symptoms have appeared within four
hours. The period of incubation depends upon the amount
of toxin ingested and the ability of Innate Intelligence to
adapt the body to the poison.</p>

<p>The <b>symptoms</b> usually begin with headache and dizziness,
feeling of fatigue and muscular weakness. One of the early
symptoms is a disturbance of vision which may progress until
the patient is blind. Both the extrinsic and intrinsic muscles
of the eye become involved. There is blepharoptosis and the
pupils become dilated. There is diplopia and the loss of
adaptative response of the eye to the light. There is soon
complete loss of accommodation, opthalmoplegia, nystagmus,
strabismus and in some cases photophobia.</p>

<p>Concurrent with the beginning of the disturbances of vision
there is difficulty in swallowing and talking, with a feeling
of throat contraction. There may be frequent attacks of
strangling, with extreme dryness of the mouth and throat,
which result in a cough. Stubborn constipation results from
lack of peristalsis. Beginning in the intestines and passing
gradually upward there is progressive, ascending paralysis.
The lack of proper nervous tone is evidenced by fatigue,
drowsiness, headache and unsteadiness in walking which may
result in a steppage gait, there is great muscular weakness
and incontinence of urine. Other prominent symptoms are an
insufficient secretion of saliva, sweat and tears and a deficiency
in the excretion of urine. This results in a typical “dry man”
condition. Later in the course of the dis-ease the temperature
is subnormal and the pulse rapid. There may be paralysis of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
the laryngeal and pharyngeal muscles, which results in an
inability to swallow. There may be complete aphonia. The
case is very likely to develop bronchopneumonia, in which
event there will be temperature. The facial expression is that
of great anxiety and utter helplessness. The sensation of
strangling becomes more frequent and there is a struggle for
breath, death eventually resulting. The duration of this dis-ease
varies greatly. Death may result in forty-eight hours
after the poison has been ingested. Seldom will a condition
run more than eight days. In cases that recover, convalescence
is very slow. The patient may be many months recovering.
The prognosis in botulism is considered very unfavorable, the
mortality being as high as 100% in some outbreaks. The
lowest mortality, according to statistics, is 37.5%.</p>

<p>Microscopic examination of the bodies which are the victims
of botulism has revealed a great congestion of the central
nervous system and also of the abdominal and thoracic viscera.
Some have shown a great number of hemorrhages at the base
of the brain and the upper portion of the spinal cord; the
lungs are also congested. Originally it was supposed that
food intoxication came only from sausage or other meat, but
it has later been proven that this poison might develop not
only in meat but in such food as string beans, cottage cheese,
corn, asparagus, spinach and ripe olives. It has also been
found in turkey, chicken and fish. Most cases of botulism
result from the eating of foods that have received some preservative
treatment; seldom will it be caused from the eating
of fresh foods. Chiropractically this condition is in the poison
family and would involve S.P. and K.P. as a major.</p>


<h3>Adulteration of Food</h3>

<p>Food adulteration may consist in:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">1—Extraction of nutritive substances.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">2—Addition of substances lowering the quality of the
food.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">3—Substituting inferior grades of food.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">4—Fraudulent labeling of food.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">5—Changing the appearance of food by coloring or other
methods which will conceal the inferior quality.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">6—Adding injurious substances for the purpose of preserving
the food.</p>
</div>

<p>The Pure Food Act of 1906 makes the following classification
in a statement of the methods which are considered in
the adulteration of foods:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">1—“If any substance has been mixed and packed with
it so as to reduce or lower or injuriously affect its
quality or strength.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">2—“If any substance has been substituted, wholly or in
part, for the article.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">3—“If any valuable constituent or article has been,
wholly or in part, abstracted.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">4—“If it is mixed, colored, powdered, coated or stained
in any manner whereby damage or inferiority is
concealed.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">5—“If it contains any poisons or other added deleterious
ingredient, which may render such articles injurious
to health.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">6—“If it consists in whole or in part of a filthy, decomposed
or putrid animal or vegetable substance, or
any portion of an animal unfit for food, whether
manufactured or not, or if it is the product of a
dis-eased animal or one that has died otherwise than
by slaughter.”</p>
</div>

<p>Rosenau gives the following as the most common adulterations:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Cottonseed oil is sold as olive oil; honey may contain
glucose; cocoa and chocolate are frequently mixed
with both starch and sugar; coffee is extensively adulterated
with caramel, pea-meal, chickory and saccharose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
extracts; lard is mixed with cheaper fats or cotton seed
oil; saccharin is substituted for cane sugar; cereals give
bulk and weight to sausages; gypsum or bran is added to
flour; barium sulphate to powdered sugar, flour to turmeric
or corn-meal to mustard; oleomargarine is sold as
butter; distilled and colored vinegar is sold as cider
vinegar; ground spices are adulterated with cocoanut
shells, rice, flour and ashes; water, sugar and tartaric
sold as lemonade; wines and liquors are sometimes adulterated
with alum; baryta, caustic lime, salicylic acid,
wood alcohol and hematoxylin, terra alba, kaolin, and
various pigments are sometimes added to candies; gum
drops are largely made with petroleum paraffin products;
much of the maple sugar formerly sold was made from
glucose and coloring matter.”</p>
</div>

<p>A good illustration of separating the nutritive substances
is the extraction of cream from milk and certain elements
from meat. There is really no objection to abstracting nutritive
elements from food if afterward that food is properly
labeled; there is no objection in taking cream out of milk and
selling the skim milk, providing it is not sold for whole milk.</p>

<p>An illustration of lowering the quality of the food is the
addition of water to milk, of bran to flour, of bariumsulphate
to powdered sugar.</p>

<p>An illustration of substitution would be to substitute saccharine
for sugar, oleomargarine for butter, cottonseed oil for
olive oil.</p>

<h2>COMPOSITION OF MILK</h2>


<h3>Milk as a Food</h3>

<p>Milk contains all the elements necessary in a balanced diet
for the adult and furnishes an almost perfect food for the
suckling. Milk is lacking in iron and roughage and is therefore
not suitable for the sole diet of adults. This is compensated
for in the infant by a large amount of iron which is
contained in the spleen and furnishes this necessary element
during the suckling period. There is no other single food
that will so well promote the growth and development in
young children. Milk is easily digested, is palatable, and
forms one of our best and most important articles of food.
It is asserted that the consumption of milk in the United
States will average about 0.6 of a pint per capita per day.
In many countries there is practically no milk used. In the
United States about 16% of the dietary consists of milk and
its products.</p>

<p>Milk is an animal secretion produced by the mammary
gland and is exceedingly complex in its composition. It consists
chiefly of water containing various solids in solution.
Cow’s milk consists of 87% water and 13% solids. The solids
consist of fats in emulsion, milk sugar, albumin, casein and
mineral matter. Milk also contains such gases as oxygen,
nitrogen and carbon dioxide. It contains enzymes, phosphatids
and vitamins, also antibodies and other substances.</p>

<p>Fresh normal milk is an opaque fluid of white or yellowish-white
color and has a sweetish taste and rather pleasant odor.
In reaction milk is amphoteric, that is, it is acid to litmus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
and alkaline to turmeric. The specific gravity of cow’s milk
is from 1.027 to 1.035. Under the microscope it is found to
contain fat globules and cells, also bacteria and other objects.
The oxygen and nitrogen that are found in milk are thought
to be carried into it mechanically from the air during the
process of milking. Lecithin, cholestrin, citric acid, lactosin,
orotic acid and ammonia are found in milk in small quantities.</p>


<h3>Proteins</h3>

<p>Casein, lactalbumin, and lactoglobulin are the three proteins
found in milk and are usually constant in a given species.</p>

<p>Casein is found nowhere in nature except in the secretion
of the mammary glands. It is highly specialized and, as a
nucleoalbumin, contains a certain amount of phosphorus.
Lactalbumin is a protein found in quantities varying from
0.2% to 0.8%. It is similar to the serum albumin in blood
and coagulates at 70° C. There is a mere trace of lactoglobulin
in milk. It is insoluble in water.</p>


<h3>Fat</h3>

<p>Milk contains fat in emulsion; that is, the fat is suspended
in the serum of milk in the form of emulsion. The fat is
lighter than the milk serum and therefore rises to the top
in the form of cream, or the fat may be separated from the
milk by centrifugal force. Cream does not consist in fat
globules alone but contains the same constituents as the milk,
only it is very much richer in fat. By agitating the cream,
as in a churn, or by means of shaking, the fat globules will
coalesce and form into lumps of butter. It is stated by some
authors that cream contains a larger number of bacteria than
skim milk. The fore milk, or that which is first milked from
the udder, has a small amount of fat; the last that is taken,
which is known as the strippings, may contain as much as
9% or 10% of fat. An increase in the temperature of the
milk will retard the rising of the fat and if the temperature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
is kept above 65° C. for any length of time, cream will not
form on top. Therefore, it follows that a moderately low
temperature will increase the rapidity with which fat rises
to the top of the milk.</p>

<p>Parkes says, “Milk should not have less than 12.5% of
total solids of which 3.5% is fat and 0.7% is salts; ... the
percentage of cream by volume not less than 10%.”</p>

<p>Infants placed on a diet of milk that is too rich in fats
will thrive for a while, but in time will lose weight and
show other symptoms, indicating the inability of Innate to
digest the food. The stools become hard and dry, of a pale
color and composed largely of fat soaps. This shows that
Innate is unable to furnish sufficient alkaline bases through
the body to saponify the excessive amount of fat in the intestines.
This results in a condition resembling acidosis.</p>


<h3>Vitamins</h3>

<p>Milk is found to contain all three vitamins, A, B, and C,
known as the fat-soluble A, water-soluble B, and water-soluble C.
Cream is rich in vitamin A. This vitamin increases
growth and promotes nutrition and is therefore valuable
in the diet of the young. Vitamin A and B are not
destroyed by heat, unless it be a very great degree for a long
period of time; they also resist drying and age. For this latter
reason milk may be used in cooking and still retain the
virtues of these two vitamins, as well as do evaporated milk
and dried milk. Vitamin C is impaired and may be completely
destroyed by high temperature and deteriorates with age and
with drying. There is no article of food (diet) that is superior
to milk in dietetic and nutritional value, and especially is this
true of butter fat. The standard by which milk is tested is
the amount of butter fat it contains.</p>


<h3>Lactose or Milk Sugar</h3>

<p>Milk contains what is known as milk sugar or lactose. It
is white crystalline sugar, has a slightly sweet taste and is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
soluble in water. When acted upon by microörganisms it is
changed into glucose, and the glucose is then reduced to lactic
acid, the lactic acid being the cause of the milk souring. Milk
sugar is found nowhere else in Nature.</p>


<h2>SANITARY MEASURES IN PRODUCTION</h2>


<h3>Milk, a Germ Medium</h3>

<p>Milk, because of its characteristic qualities, forms a medium
in which all kinds of bacteria and germs, or low forms of life,
thrive. When we consider the processes necessary to obtain
the milk and deliver it to the consumer, even though the most
rigid sanitary methods are observed, it can readily be seen that
milk is exposed to almost all kinds of dirt and to the different
forms of organisms.</p>

<p>It is very difficult to obtain milk in a state of purity and
if germs played as important a part in the production of dis-ease
as is thought by some, one of the most important articles
of diet would be lost to mankind. Great quantities of these
germs are ingested into the stomach of individuals who drink
milk.</p>

<p>These bacteria are carried into the milk during milking
and in the handling of the milk and the retainers. Bacteriological
standards have been established, but vary a little
with different authors. Usually it is agreed that certified
milk should not contain more than 10,000 bacteria per
cubic centimeter. Market milk should not have more than
1,000,000 bacteria per cubic centimeter in the raw state
and not more than 50,000 per cubic centimeter after pasteurization.</p>

<p>It can be seen by this standard that even the relatively pure
milk contains great numbers of bacteria and yet these bacteria
are ingested into the digestive tract and no harm done.
As a matter of fact, this helps to substantiate the contention
of Chiropractic that these germs and the different bacteria are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
essential to life. There is no question, however, that poisons
may be contained in milk, and when these are taken into the
stomach Innate may not be able to properly adapt the tissues
and thus a toxic condition will be produced.</p>

<p>Because of the characteristic qualities of milk, the strictest
sanitary measures should be observed in all the processes involved,
from the time the milk is taken from the cow until
it is delivered to the customer.</p>

<p>Milk undergoes certain physical, chemical and biological
changes as soon as it is taken from the cow: the cream rises
and thus it is separated from the milk; there is also a separation
of the solids from the fluids.</p>


<h3>Care in the Milking</h3>

<p>A sanitary environment should be provided for the
cows and special care should be taken in the process of
milking to prevent the milk from becoming contaminated
with dirt and filth. Those who handle this milk should
take proper precautions to prevent dirt from getting into it.
All utensils should be kept clean, sweet and free from sour
milk.</p>

<p>Sanitary measures should include: Proper care and feeding,
or the health of the milch cows; (2) proper regulation
of the bottling and transportation of the milk. The cows
should by all means be healthy, inasmuch as milk is an animal
secretion. It is certain that if the animal is suffering from
dis-ease, this secretion will not be normal. Over-exertion and
fright will also affect the milk. Care must be exercised to
detect dis-ease and such dis-eased animals should be separated
from the herd and their milk not used.</p>


<h3>Care of the Cows</h3>

<p>The cows should have plenty of exercise, but care should
be taken that they are not frightened or over-exerted. They
should be provided with proper protection from the weather<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
and should have plenty of fresh hay, ground whole grain, and,
when possible, be allowed to graze. Spoiled vegetables or
fruits, foul or fermented foods are detrimental to dairy cows.
A proper supply of salt is necessary and plenty of pure, fresh
water is absolutely essential for the health of cows.</p>


<h3>Barns and Barnyards</h3>

<p>The barns and barnyards where milch cows are kept should
be free from manure, pools of stagnant water, dirt and refuse.
The ground should be well drained so that it will not become
water-logged. Such ground should be located on elevations
to assure proper drainage. The habit of allowing the refuse
to accumulate in large quantities before hauling it away is not
only repulsive but very unsanitary and may become a source
of pollution of the milk supply.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="image259" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image259.jpg" alt="barn stalls">
</figure>

<p>Stable should be constructed to assure proper ventilation
and to provide proper shelter for the animals. The floors
should be of material that is non-absorbent, well drained, and
easily cleaned. Concrete is best. Each cow should have a
separate stall furnished with a stanchion. The walls should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
be of material that can be cleaned. There should be 600 cubic
feet space for each cow in the barn.</p>


<h3>Bottling</h3>

<p>Milk should be strained through gauze placed over the
wire strainer. All the utensils should be thoroughly cleaned
after each milking and, if possible, sterilized in a steam
sterilizer. The straining should not be done in the barns
where the cows are, but in special separate milk houses. The
bottling should be done only in establishments specially fitted
for such purpose.</p>


<h3>Proper Temperature</h3>

<p>Milk should be kept at a temperature not above 50° F.
during transportation. The cans or bottles should be properly
covered, sealed, and the milk protected from too much agitation.</p>

<p>Because milk undergoes a very rapid change, beginning
almost as soon as it is drawn from the cow, it is necessary
to either consume it in a short time or provide some means
of preserving it. Milk soon deteriorates, becomes sour and
unfit for use as food.</p>

<p>The best means of preserving milk is to keep it at a low
temperature. Bacteria are not destroyed in low temperature,
but the activity is inhibited and their development retarded.
In this way milk is kept from souring and from undergoing
fermentative changes. The digestibility and character of milk
are not changed by cold, and it will be sweet for a day or
even longer if kept at a temperature under 50° F.</p>

<p>An entirely sterile milk may be furnished only by raising
the temperature to 248° F. for at least two hours, but this
destroys the milk ferments. There are certain changes produced
by boiling milk which renders it less desirable for food,
making it less digestible. It is, therefore, especially undesirable
for infants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREPARATION_OF_MILK_AND_MILK_PRODUCTS">PREPARATION OF MILK AND MILK PRODUCTS</h2>

<h3>Pasteurization of Milk</h3>

<p>In pasteurizing milk it is heated to a temperature of 60° C.
(140° F.) for a period of twenty minutes. This destroys the
so-called pathogenic germs, yet does not destroy the ordinary
milk ferments. It does not change its digestibility nor alter
the taste or appearance.</p>

<p>All of the so-called pathogenic germs, such as tuberculosis,
typhoid, dysentery and diphtheria, for example, are completely
destroyed by pasteurization, but the ferments are not destroyed
and the milk is in no way altered. This process may be accomplished
on a large scale and thus furnish as safe milk for
commercial consumption. Pasteurized milk should be rapidly
cooled after heating, and if kept cool furnishes a clean, healthy
milk entirely safe and satisfactory for infant food as well as
for adults.</p>

<p>Pasteurization furnishes a purified milk but not a pure
milk. It is undoubtedly the best means of preservation
and may be considered as bearing the same relation to
purification of milk as filtration bears to purification of
water.</p>

<p>The use of formaldehyde, borax and boracic acid is as
objectionable in artificial preservation of milk as in the
preservation of meat and other foods and should not be
tolerated.</p>


<h3>Condensed Milk</h3>

<p>Milk is condensed by removing some of the water. It
is made either from skim or whole milk. It may be unsweetened
or sweetened with cane sugar. Condensed and
evaporated milk should contain a label stating the grade
of milk used. Condensed and evaporated milk are poor in
vitamin C.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span></p>


<h3>Dry Milk</h3>

<p>It has been found that by certain processes it is possible
to dry milk, taking all the water out and leaving a powder.
This may be accomplished and still retain most of the nutritive
value of the milk. Vitamin fat soluble A and water
soluble B remain practically the same, but water soluble C
vitamin is diminished. Babies fed on dried milk will thrive,
but orange juice or some other food containing antiscorbutic
properties must be given to compensate for the loss of vitamin C.
Dried milk provides an adequate supply to many
parts of the country and to the cities, where it is difficult
to obtain fresh milk.</p>


<h3>Butter</h3>

<p>Butter is produced by placing cream in a proper apparatus
and agitating or churning it until the fat globules coalesce
into lumps. These lumps are then taken out of the serum
known as the buttermilk and the water and milk worked out
until it becomes more or less solid. When butter has had the
milk and water worked out of it the constituents should be
in about the following proportions: Fat, 83.5%; curd, 1.0%;
ash, 1.5%; milk sugar, 1.0%; water, 13.0%. By weight butter
should never contain more than 16% of water and should
contain at least 80% of fat.</p>

<p>Owing to the conversion of the fat into fatty acids butter
will, in the course of time, become acid, rancid and unfit for
table use.</p>

<p>Oleomargarine is a product resembling butter. It is manufactured
from animal fats and vegetable oils. It is not as
desirable an article of diet as butter. It contains margarine
fat and only .5% of the volatile fats, while butter fat contains
about 8%.</p>

<p>Oleomargarine may be distinguished from butter by boiling.
Butter boils more quietly and a foam is formed on top,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
while oleomargarine sputters much like oil mixed with water
and there is little or no foam produced.</p>


<h3>Cheese</h3>

<p>Cheese is manufactured from skim milk, whole milk, or
milk to which cream has been added. The more cream the
richer is the product. Coagulation of the milk is accomplished
by adding rennet; the curd is then pressed to expel the whey;
next it is placed in molds and kept in a cool place to ripen.
After cheese has been properly ripened it makes an excellent
article of diet. It contains a large proportion of nitrogenous
substances. There are many grades of cheese, the quality
depending not only upon the process involved in the manufacturing,
but also upon the richness of the milk from which
it is made.</p>

<h3>Meat, an Article of Diet</h3>

<p>Meat is used as an article of food by most of the civilized
races. It, however, as a universal diet, is of quite recent
origin. Since the modern, efficient refrigerating processes,
canning, and improved facilities of transportation, the use of
meat as an article of diet has become very popular and
economic.</p>


<h3>Composition of Meat</h3>

<p>Meat is composed of muscle tissue and the associated structures,
such as connective tissue, adipose tissue, blood vessels,
nerves and lymphatic vessels. Chiefly, meat is found to be
composed of proteins, fats, ash carbohydrates and water—the
percentage of water varying from 10% to 78%, depending
upon the cut. Whether the meat is tough or tender depends
upon the thickness of the walls of the muscle tubes and the
presence of connective tissue, which binds the muscles together.
Flesh of young domesticated animals is more tender
than flesh of old animals or of wild animals. Flavor of the
meat is also affected by the animal’s age. Muscle tissue in
its inorganic content resembles the seed more than the leaf
elements of diet, both in amount and in its relative proportions.
Albuminoids and gelatinoids are also contained in
meat to quite a degree.</p>

<p>Immediately after slaughter, meat has an alkaline reaction
and is found to be tough and of a sweetish taste and of a
somewhat unpleasant flavor. Sarcolactic soon develops, giving
an acid reaction to the meat. Autolytic enzymes soon
form and this action, together with the bacterial action, softens
the connective tissue and fibers. This results in the meat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
becoming more tender and also of a more desirable flavor.
For these reasons meat should be allowed to remain under
proper refrigeration for a sufficient length of time so that
this action can take place. It is obvious, therefore, that meat
is not so desirable for food immediately upon slaughter. Great
care must be taken during the period of refrigeration that it
does not become contaminated.</p>


<h3>Food Value of Meat</h3>

<p>The presence of proteins and fats in meat determines its
nutrient value. Nitrogenous extracts, also known as meat
bases, have but little value as foods. As already stated, meat
compares more favorably with seeds that are used for diet
rather than the leaves of plants. As a matter of fact, this
food, more particularly muscle tissue, differs from seeds only
in one respect. This is in the quality of proteins. In meat
the proteins are complete while those of seeds are incomplete.
Meat is relatively poor in the vitamin, fat soluble A. There
are many articles of diet which have a much higher nutritive
value than meat.</p>

<p>There is prepared from beef a soup stock which is known
as beef extract. Manufacturers of this soup stock assert that
one pound of beef extract contains the nutrient properties of
many pounds of meat. Doctor Wiley, however, says that this
assertion is erroneous. These extracts are of value since
from them there may be obtained a more speedy, soluble
nutrient which may be desirable for patients in a weakened
condition. There should be a distinction, however, made between
beef extract and beef juice. Beef juice is obtained by
putting the meat under pressure and forcing the juices out.
Thus, this juice contains a larger percentage of albuminous
nutrient material than does beef extract.</p>


<h3>Sources of Meat</h3>

<p>Cattle, sheep and swine form the principal source of meat,
although horse flesh and even the flesh of dogs is used in some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
countries. From a hygienic or sanitary standpoint there are
no particular objections to the use of horse or dog meat for
food. Horse meat is very much coarser than either beef or
pork; it does not have the same marble appearance and has a
sickening odor. When properly prepared it is difficult to distinguish
it from beef.</p>

<p>From a hygienic standpoint there are certain conditions
which render the meat of animals unfit for food. They are:
First, the death of animals from old age, dis-ease or accident;
second, animals dying from injury, drugs, overwork or
fright; third, animals that are too young.</p>


<h3>Care of Food Animals</h3>

<p>Proper care of the animal bears a close relationship to its
health and consequently to the health of the people who feed
upon its flesh.</p>

<p>The domestic animals should be properly housed and protected
from the weather, should have plenty of pure water
and should be provided with wholesome food. They should
be properly inspected before they are slaughtered and after
the animals are slaughtered and prepared for market the meat
should be thoroughly inspected.</p>


<h3>Meat Unfit for Food</h3>

<p>Meat is often rendered dangerous to health by the adulterating
processes through which it is put. There are many
ways in which meat may be adulterated. (See table under
Food Adulteration.)</p>

<p>Slightly spoiled meat is a great source of danger. It is
very difficult to recognize spoiled meat, even though the
deteriorating processes which have taken place are great
enough to injure the health of those who eat it. We are not
referring to decomposed meat, for it is a very easy matter to
recognize this by its offensive odor. The appearance may not
thoroughly be affected by even the most serious infection of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
the deadly poisons. However, inspectors are supposed to
reject meat that does not possess the raw, fresh appearance,
or meat from which any amount of fluid of an abnormal color
exudes upon pressure.</p>


<h3>Danger to Health</h3>

<p>From a hygienic standpoint the danger to health from
meat may be classed as: (a) infection from entozoa; (b) infection
by bacteria; (c) toxins and ptomaines. These conditions
may result from: (a) dis-eases of the food animals;
(b) postmortem changes that may take place in the meat;
(c) infection of the meat; (d) adulteration; (e) the use of
preservatives. Such parasites as tapeworm, trichina and
echinococci may result from spoiled meat.</p>


<h3>Tapeworm</h3>

<p>Meat infection may result in two species of tapeworm,
the tænia saginata and the tænia solium. The tænia saginata
is due to infection from beef, which is known in lay terms as
measly beef. The tænia solium is due to infection from pork,
which is known in lay terminology as measly pork. The
larva of the tænia solium appears in hogs and is known
as bladder worms, from the fact that it is found incased in
small cysts in the intestines, the muscle fibers, brain and other
parts. The larva of the tænia saginata is found in the muscular
fibers and connective tissue of cattle and when ingested in man
develops into the tænia saginata.</p>


<h3>Trichinosis</h3>

<p>There is a parasite known as trichina spiralis which is
found as a minute spiral worm in the muscular fibers of pork.
It is visible to the naked eye as white specks. The ingestion of
this parasite into a person with subluxations, causing interference
with transmission of mental impulses, produces a condition
which is called trichinosis. It is an acute condition and
the symptoms resemble typhoid fever. It often results fatally.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span></p>


<h3>Echinococcus</h3>

<p>The echinococcus is sometimes found in the meat of hogs,
sheep and cattle. When the eggs are ingested in man they
hatch and the embryo pierces the mucosa and lodges in the
tissues, forming a hydatid or cyst. These cysts develop and
increase in size as the larvæ multiply.</p>

<p>As the eggs are ingested into the digestive tract of man
there is created a necessity for adaptative action on the part
of Innate Intelligence for the purpose of expelling them. This
action will be sufficient to result in the expulsion of the larvæ
if there is no interference with the transmission of mental impulses
to the tissue cells. When this action takes place there
will be no injury done, but if the action does not take place
the eggs remain in the body and hatch, producing what is
known as a hydatid dis-ease.</p>

</div>


<p class="center no-indent fs120 bold">THE BABY</p>

<p>Chiropractic has nothing to do with obstetrics, but the
chiropractor should be informed on the subject of child
hygiene. It must be remembered that our idea is not to substitute
here for the services of the obstetrician, a food diet for
the infant when the mother is unable to nurse her child. The
proper application of Chiropractic will eventually enable the
mother, who might otherwise be unable to do so, to nurse
her baby.</p>

<p>The child is the most helpless of the animal kingdom and
requires special attention. This must come through the
observation of Nature’s laws and an educated adaptation by
means of substituting the educated mind of the adult for that
of the infant.</p>


<h3>Feeding</h3>

<p>The child that is normal will give little trouble since
Nature has made provision for all processes necessary to
maintain the normal functions of the body. In order that
these processes be maintained it is necessary to have food,
proper environment, and sufficient exercise. When the mother
is able to nurse the babe the problem of nourishment is solved.
If the mother is unable to nurse the child and if the condition
which makes this impossible is of such long standing that
adjustments will not get results on the mother within the
nursing period of her child, then the question of baby food
should be left to the obstetrician who can prescribe the proper
diet.</p>

<p>If the child has difficulty in digesting the food, adjustments
should be given to enable Innate to bring about the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
proper adaptation. The bottle fed baby will require more
care than the breast fed baby. Special care must be exercised
to keep the bottles and other receptacles in a proper sanitary
condition. This can be done by boiling them. Great care
must be taken that the nipples used on the bottle are not
allowed to become sour and otherwise unhygienic.</p>

<p>Cows’ milk may be used for bottle fed babies, but the
most rigid sanitary measures should be used in producing and
delivering the milk. There are many baby foods on the
market, but the prescribing of food for the bottle-fed baby
does not come within the scope of the chiropractor. This
should be left to the obstetrician who has specialized in this
work. It is not within the scope of Chiropractic to prescribe
the kind of food that a bottle-fed baby needs, but the chiropractor
must realize the importance of the right kind of food
and the necessity for a proper innate adaptation to the kind
of food given. Proper feeding is necessary for normal development,
although it alone will not insure proper growth and
development. The digestive organs must work normally and
there must be proper coördinate action between the glands of
the body. For this proper balance to be maintained there
must be a normal transmission of mental impulses to all parts
of the body.</p>

<p>The child that is getting a properly balanced ration and
still is not developing normally should receive immediate attention
at the hands of a competent chiropractor. No phase of
the chiropractor’s work brings such gratifying results as the
care of infants and babies, yet in no other phase will he find
so much to baffle him. If the child is unable to digest the
food then adjustments should be given.</p>


<h3>Sleep</h3>

<p>The infant requires much sleep and for the first two or
three days this sleep will be very deep. The ordeal of labor
is very trying on the infant and in cases involving great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
labor difficulty the first sleep of the infant may be so profound
that it may appear to be coma. This may last for
several hours, but if there are no convulsions or contractures
there is no occasion for alarm; otherwise, this might indicate
an incoördination in the brain.</p>

<p>After this first deep sleep, and especially after the first
month, the infant will not sleep so soundly, although the sleep
will be quiet. The deep, heavy sleep of childhood will be
observed after the second or third year. The healthy infant
sleeps almost all the time during the first few weeks, usually
from twenty to twenty-two hours out of twenty-four. After
that and for the first six or eight months, he sleeps from
sixteen to eighteen hours out of the twenty-four. The healthy
infant a few weeks old will awaken only when disturbed or
when hungry. A child one year of age should have at least
fourteen hours of sleep and more would not be excessive.
This sleep should be taken about twelve hours at night and
the balance during the day. A child two years of age requires
about the same amount. At four years, eleven to twelve hours
may be sufficient. Up to six years of age the child should
take a daily nap. Ten to eleven hours’ sleep is considered
sufficient from the age of six to ten years. The youth up to
sixteen or seventeen years of age should have not less than
nine hours of sleep and even more will not be excessive.</p>

<p>The nervous mechanism of the infant is a very delicate
organization and often the fond parents do the child an injustice
by not giving due consideration to the environment
surrounding him the first year of life. The greatest development
of the brain takes place during the first two years. To
have the proper development of the nervous system there must
be a quiet environment and the elimination of anything that
will excite the child or tend to create nervousness. If the
child is unduly susceptible to noise and is irritable and nervous,
cries out or is too easily startled, there is a cause for this
and a very careful analysis should be given and the causative<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
subluxations found and adjusted immediately. The nervousness
may be due to some disorder such as gastric, intestinal
indigestion, poor elimination or directly to a cervical subluxation.</p>

<p>Playing violently with the young child should not be indulged
in. It is a common failing of parents to want the
baby to make a good appearance and therefore he is often
stimulated to laughter by means that are detrimental to his
health. This should not be done.</p>


<h3>Exercise</h3>

<p>The need for exercise is quite apparent and this need is
as great in the infant as in the adult. Proper exercise is important
from the standpoint of hygiene and we will readily
realize this when we observe the provisions which have been
made in Nature to take care of this very important process.
The child gets his exercise from the natural instincts in his
nature to run and play. His curiosity performs an important
function in this respect. This keeps him running about to
investigate the things about him. This takes care of the child
that is thrown in a natural environment where there is plenty
of room for him to run and play indoors and out, but it does
not take care of the infant and the child in the city or apartment
who gets the proper amount of exercise only where
there is special provision made for it.</p>

<p>The infant gets his exercise by kicking, therefore the clothing
should not be too tight. If it is, it prevents this natural
exercise which is an adaptation on the part of Innate Intelligence.
It is advisable to place the nude baby on his back
for a few minutes at a time, preferably following the bath.
In this way he can kick to his heart’s content. Crying is
another means of exercise open to the child. The lusty cry
of the infant is an advantage enabling the expansion of the
lungs and the exercising of the abdominal muscles, the diaphragm
and other structures that would otherwise get very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
little exercise. Of course attention must be given the crying
child to see that there is nothing wrong. The crying may
be the result of pain or discomfort from the clothing, but it
does not take a mother or nurse long to recognize the different
cries.</p>

<p>The child gets a certain amount of exercise from the
handling which he receives. A child that is left in the crib
and does not get the proper handling will be fretful and will
not do well. Of course the infant must not be handled roughly
and at no time should he be disturbed from sleep. The child
who is given opportunity to exert himself and who receives
the proper exercise through handling will relish his milk,
digestion will be normal, other things being equal, and in
every way he will present a more healthful appearance.</p>

<p>Children old enough to creep will get a sufficient amount
of exercise in this way. Precautions must be taken, however,
that the child is not allowed to remain on the floor when there
are drafts or when the floor is cold as it is likely to be in
winter in homes that are not provided with furnace heat.
It must be remembered that the child is very curious and
is likely to get hurt unless properly protected. He should
not be restrained in creeping and he should be permitted to
spend some time romping on the floor each day. Children
should not be encouraged to stand when too young since the
weight of the body tends to produce bow-legs.</p>

<p>Outdoor exercise should be provided for the children at
an early age. This should include every sort of exercise and
play. It is an advantage to have systematic games, for this
not only gives a regular amount of exercise but also has an
influence on the mind of the child which will aid in forming
regular and systematic habits of thought and action. In early
childhood there need be no difference in the exercise of the
two sexes. It is necessary only to regulate the amount of
exertion for the more delicate children. In this respect competitive
games may tend to stimulate children to play too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
hard in an effort to win. Especially is the delicate child likely
to overdo since no child likes for other children to know that
he is not as physically fit as his playmates. There are no
objections from a hygienic standpoint, for the exercise to be
sufficiently strenuous to produce muscular fatigue, but it must
never be so strenuous or so prolonged as to produce muscular
exhaustion. The exercise should develop all parts of the
body. In this way there will be a symmetrical body development.</p>


<h3>Playroom</h3>

<p>In stormy weather and in winter time when children can
not get outdoors they should get exercise indoors. In practically
every home a room could be fitted up as a playroom
or nursery. It need not be elaborate and could be a bedroom
used for a playroom during the day. This room should be
well lighted and not kept too warm. The right temperature
is about 55° F. Since an abundance of light is necessary the
room should not be on the north, for the direct rays of the
sun are to be desired and some provision should be made to
admit them. All drafts must be avoided, yet a sufficient
amount of air must be admitted so as to prevent the air
from becoming vitiated. The best method of accomplishing
this is by means of ventilators placed in the windows. Occasionally
the doors and windows should be opened and the
room thoroughly aired. This should be done while the children
are absent from the room.</p>

<p>The furniture in the playroom should be substantial and
of such a character that it can easily be cleaned and kept in
a sanitary condition.</p>


<h3>Sleeping Rooms or Nurseries</h3>

<p>When it is possible in a home a room should be set aside
for the nursery. This room should be well lighted, properly
ventilated, and the heat and humidity should be carefully regulated.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>
This room is to be the chief home of the infant for
the first few months. Therefore it should meet the needs of
the infant. It should receive the direct rays of the sun during
the day. No processes, such as preparation of food, or
washing of diapers, for example, should be permitted in this
room. As far as possible gas plates, heaters, or gas lights
should be avoided.</p>

<p>The nursery should not be kept too warm. A temperature
of 70° F. is proper during the day. During the first few weeks
it should not be allowed to drop below 65° F. through the
night. For children over two months of age the temperature
during the night may go as low as 60° F. but not below 50° F.</p>

<p>It is more sanitary for the infant to have a separate bed.
Both mother and babe will rest better and there will not be
the tendency for the baby to nurse too frequently during the
night. The infant should be placed in a crib without rockers.
A basket or bassinet is very convenient and sanitary. The
sides of the bassinet may be lined and this will prevent drafts
and assist materially in keeping the baby warm. The pillow
should be small and soft. It is advisable to change the position
of the child occasionally while sleeping. It must be remembered
that the child is unable to turn should he become
cramped or should he become tired from lying in one position.
The average mother knows how to take care of her
child in a general way and nurses have had special training
in this respect, but these simple necessities should not be
beneath the notice of the chiropractor. Especially is this of
importance in determining the cause of irritability in the
infant. Attention must be given to skin irritation, especially
resulting from carelessness in the changing of the diaper and
in keeping the body of the child otherwise clean. It is not,
however, the intention of the author to present in this text
complete instruction in the care of infants except from the
general viewpoint of hygiene. The chiropractor is not to be
a nurse, but he must know the rules of hygiene since there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>
are many conditions of infancy which result from a violation
of these rules.</p>

<p>After the first week or two the infant should be taken out
of doors if it is in the summer. The open air is healthful
for the young children and they should be kept outdoors a
part of each day. The eyes must be protected from the sun
and the head from the wind. The child, of course, should be
properly dressed for out of doors. At first the child must
be kept out only a few minutes, since sufficient time must
be allowed for adaptation to take place, or in other words,
for the child to become accustomed to the change. Before
children are taken out the first time it is well to get them
accustomed to the change by opening the doors and windows
of the room that there may be a gradual cooling of the temperature.
The child born in the fall or winter must not be
deprived of fresh air even though the weather will not permit
the outside airing. The child may be dressed as for an outdoor
airing, then the doors and windows opened. Great care must
be exercised or the child will take cold.</p>


<h3>Control of Bowels and Bladder</h3>

<p>While the chiropractor will have little if anything to do
in advising mothers how to train their children to answer the
“call of Nature,” yet he should be familiar with methods that
are suggested for such training and certainly he should recognize
the importance from a hygienic standpoint of such regular
habits. It might be stated here that the normal movement
of the young infant’s bowels should be at least twice a day.</p>

<p>At a very early age children learn to evacuate the bowels
when placed upon a nursery chair. This requires a great deal
of patience and regularity on the part of the mother or nurse.
Even at the early age of three months the child may be trained
to such a degree that the napkin will seldom be soiled from
the movements of the bowels. This saves an enormous amount
of work and certainly is more pleasant for the child, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>
much more sanitary. There is, however, another advantage
having the young child form this regular habit; it is very
probable that a habit formed this early will be followed the
entire life, and thus the tendency for the educated mind to
neglect this very important innate function will be averted.
The best time to place the child upon the nursery chair is
immediately following feeding.</p>

<p>Training the child to empty the bladder at stated times
is more difficult, although with patient and intelligent effort
this may be accomplished. Many children at the age of one
year are able to indicate when they desire to empty the
bladder. This adds materially to the comfort of the child
and certainly makes it very much easier to care for him.
Some mothers are able to dispense with the diapers during
the day by the time the child is a year old and some even
at an earlier age. If there is no special effort put forth to
train the child in this respect it will be necessary to keep
him in diapers as late as two and a half years. After this
age the child should have no difficulty in holding the urine
during the night. If there is such difficulty adjustments should
be given to correct the cause for the nocturnal enuresis.</p>


<h3>Growth and Development</h3>

<p>Since growth of the child is the best evidence of health,
some attention should be given it and should there be any
arrest in development the cause should be carefully determined.
Arrested progress always indicates that something
is wrong and therefore adjustments are needed. Although
normal growth does not prove perfect health by any means,
yet if the child is not growing and properly developing he is
not enjoying proper health.</p>


<h3>Weight</h3>

<p>From observation made of a great number of cases by
authorities the average weight for girls at birth is a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>
over seven pounds, while that of boys is about seven and a
half pounds. Some weigh more, some less. There is a loss
of weight the first three days, this being greatest the first
day. After the third day the child begins gradually to increase
in weight and by the tenth day will have gained all
that was lost the first three days, reaching the birth-weight
about the tenth day. The artificially fed babies gain more
slowly, even though they may be perfectly healthy and vigorous.
The greatest increase that is made in the weight of
children the first year is during the first three months. Normally
the average child will gain from five to six ounces each
week during the first six months, but only about half this
much the second six months. The data given here must be
considered only as an average, no standard can be set, but
the variation must be within certain limits, otherwise it will
be indicative of abnormality.</p>

<p>During the first two years the weight of children is considered
with reference to age, but after this it is studied with
relation to height. This latter method is much more accurate.
The age, however, must always enter into the consideration,
for of two children of the same height but of different ages
the older should be the heavier. There is much less variation
in weight with reference to height than with reference to age.
Normal weight differs with different individuals and is governed
by various conditions so that a stated weight can not
be decided upon as normal in all cases. The degree of deviation
from the average weight that one may experience and
still be within the normal range is a matter of opinion. If
the weight of the child is more than 10% below the average
for his height it is a fair indication that there is a lack of
proper nutrition, either because he does not have proper food
or because the tissues can not assimilate the nutrition due to
interference with transmission. In a case of this kind the
child should be carefully analyzed and adjusted. The disturbance
may be in the digestive tract or due to an impairment
in the serous circulation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span></p>

<p>Children twelve years of age and over gain less regularly
and more spasmodically. For this reason there will be a
greater degree of variation at this age. The weight may
fall as much at 12% below the average and still the child
not be considered underweight, or as much as 20% above the
average before being considered overweight. If an observation
of the weight is to be of any value it must be made over
a period of time. The important thing is to observe whether
or not there has been a gain in weight over that period of
time. Loss of weight over a period of time indicates that
Innate is compelled to draw upon the physical in her processes
and that there is no new material with which to replace the
old. This is a warning from Innate that should be heeded.
The following table will give the idea of the average weight
for the given height of the child.</p>

<p>This table is based upon a general average taken from
various authentic sources and is for the purpose of giving the
chiropractor a general basis upon which to make observations
in growing children. The average weight is given with relation
to the average height and approximate age from the
second to the sixteenth year of life inclusive.</p>

<p>Separate weights have not been given for boys and girls.
The average weight of boys is about two pounds heavier than
that of girls at the same age up to about the thirteenth year.
From fourteen to sixteen years of age the average weight of
girls is from three to ten pounds above that of boys. The
greatest increase in the weight of girls takes place between
the thirteenth and fourteenth year, while with boys this
increase is between the sixteenth and seventeenth year.</p>

<h3>Height</h3>

<p>The same thing can be said about height as about weight
of children. There is no standard, since there are so many
variations to consider, but there is a general average. The
average length of the infant at birth is about twenty and one-half
inches. The average normal growth the first year is
about nine inches. Growth in height of the child does not
indicate much in the way of nutrition, since a child may
grow in height and at the same time lose in weight. The
greatest growth in height is made at the time of puberty.
Girls begin this rapid growth about twelve years of age and
will mature more rapidly than boys, since boys do not begin
this rapid growth until the thirteenth or fourteenth year; but,
in the fifteenth year the boys will be taller than the girls.</p>

<p>Growth in height is not retarded by malnutrition to the
same degree as is weight. The average growth of the normal
child during the second year is about four inches; for the
third year a little less; for the fourth year still a little less,
about three inches. Bowditch tells us that after the fifth year
the average growth is about two inches a year up to the time
of puberty.</p>


<h2>THE SPECIAL SENSES</h2>


<h3>Sight</h3>

<p>The eyes of the infant are very sensitive to the light and
every effort is made by the child to avoid bright light and
thus protect the eyes from glare; the eyes will innately close
when a bright light is brought before them. For the protection
of the infant’s eyes the room should be kept darkened
for the first few weeks. A subdued light will usually attract
the attention of an infant and as early as the sixth day the
child may even turn the head in an effort to follow the light
with the eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span></p>

<p>It is not uncommon for the eyelids to remain partly separated
during sleep and for the movement to be more or less
irregular during the first few weeks of life. The muscles of
the eyeballs do not always coördinate in their action. This
often results in temporary strabismus when the infant is looking
intently at an object. Perfect coördinate action is often
as late as the third or fourth month.</p>


<h3>Hearing</h3>

<p>The hearing of the infant is very acute, although it is
asserted that the child is unable to hear for the first twenty-four
hours after birth. This is due to the absence of air
in the middle ear. During the process of respiration air is
gradually admitted to the middle ear and hearing becomes
very acute, so much so that sharp noises will startle the child.
For this reason the nursery should be so located that it may
be as free as possible from noise. Noise is trying on the
nervous system and should be avoided as far as possible.
As early as two months of age the infant will turn his head
in the direction of the noise.</p>


<h3>Touch</h3>

<p>Certain portions of the infant’s body are more sensitive
than others. The tactile sensibility of the lips and tongue
is highly developed. This facilitates the process of nursing.
The forehead and external auditory meatus are more sensitive
than other parts. This creates a necessity for protection
of these parts. The child’s head should be covered, but not
the face, when taken out of doors. Touch is less acute in the
infant than in the older child.</p>

<p>The tongue of the young infant is very susceptible to
temperature. He will show a dislike for the bottle if the milk
is too hot or too cold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span></p>


<h3>Taste</h3>

<p>At one time it was thought that the child at birth had
no sense of taste, but now it is agreed that even at birth this
sense is extremely acute. The newly born infant is unable
to distinguish sweet, sour and bitter. The sucking movement
is excited by the taste of sweet, some authorities believe.
With bottle-fed babies a difference in the taste of the food
will be quickly noticed and it is with difficulty that he can
be induced to take anything that is distasteful such as sour
or bitter substances. The child very early will show that he
enjoys sweets.</p>


<h3>Smell</h3>

<p>The acuteness of this sense is not so easily determined
in the infant, although there is sufficient evidence to warrant
the conclusion that sense of smell exists from the beginning;
however, the ability to detect different odors is not developed
to any great extent until later in childhood. It is believed
that the sense of smell plays an important part at the beginning
in the child finding the mother’s breast.</p>


<h3 class="center no-indent">SPEECH</h3>

<p>The age at which the child begins to talk varies with
individuals and also with circumstances and environment.
Girls on the average will learn to talk earlier than boys; the
average is about two months earlier. The average child
begins to say such words as mamma and papa a little before
one year of age. Other simple and easy words are learned
until by the second year he is putting words together. How
early a child learns to talk depends to a great extent upon
the amount of time given him by adults in trying to teach
him. The words that he learns depend largely on what is
taught at the beginning. The reason for the average child
learning to say papa first is largely due to the efforts of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>
mother who induces the child to say this word; then naturally
an effort is made to get the child to say mamma and from
this word attention is directed to any pets there may be in
the family. Then the names of objects are learned. Verbs are
usually next learned then adverbs and adjectives. Following
these in order are the conjunctions, prepositions, and articles.
Personal pronouns are the last to be learned.</p>

<p>Children who are permitted to associate with other children
will usually learn to talk earlier than those who are reared
alone. If the child has not learned to talk at two years of
age he may be mentally deficient; or failure to talk may be
the result of being deaf or some other incoördination of the
vocal apparatus may exist. As soon as a child is discovered
to be mute he should have immediate chiropractic attention.
Many such cases are on record which show excellent results
obtained through adjustments.</p>


<h3 class="center no-indent">HEAD</h3>

<p>The occipito-frontal measurement of the child at birth is
from 13.52 inches to 13.90 inches. The most rapid growth
of the head takes place during the first year. With the average
child this growth is about four inches. For the first few
months the growth is about half an inch per month. During
the second year the circumference of the head increases only
about one inch and for the next three years, about one and
one-half inches. From this time until puberty, about five
years, it increases only about half an inch. The head develops
so rapidly so early in life that it appears to be all out of
proportion for the body.</p>


<h3>Sutures</h3>

<p>In syphilitic infants or in premature birth, the cranial bones
may be distinctly separated. This condition does not, however,
necessarily prove that either exists for often subluxations
are produced at the time of birth and these prevent the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>
normal expression of Innate Intelligence in bringing about the
adaptative processes necessary to close the sutures. This is
an abnormal condition and should receive careful consideration
at the hands of the chiropractor. Normally the main
sutures ossify at about the end of the sixth month, although
there may be some mobility at the end of the ninth month.
If after this the sutures have not entirely ossified the child
should be carefully examined for subluxations.</p>


<h3>Fontanels</h3>

<p>Under normal conditions the anterior fontanels should be
completely closed at the age of one and a half years. If at
the end of two years they have not completely closed it is
abnormal and indicates cretinism, rickets or hydrocephalus.
In case of hydrocephalus the sutures will be distinctly separated
and the head will be enlarged. This condition may
also obtain in rickets. When the fontanels are slow in closing
the child should be very carefully analyzed and an effort made
to find symptoms of other conditions which might be responsible
for this abnormality. Most excellent results have
been obtained from chiropractic adjustments in these cases.
It is quite as objectionable for the fontanels to close too soon
as it is for them to be too slow in closing and it may be much
more serious. There are many cases on record in which the
fontanels have been closed when the child was born. A case
of this kind is ordinarily beyond the reach of Chiropractic.
The closure of the fontanels during the first few weeks, or
even at the middle of the first year, indicates microcephalus.</p>

<p>Normally the anterior fontanels should be completely
closed about the eighteenth month, although it may be as
late as the twenty-second month. In rachitic children it may
be as late as the third year. In cretinism the fontanels may
become very large and sometimes do not close until the
eighth year. In hydrocephalus also the fontanels become very
large, the head develops rapidly to an enormous size and this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>
results in the spreading of the sutures. If these cases receive
adjustments early enough in life, excellent results are obtained.</p>

<p>The posterior fontanel is very much smaller than the
anterior and closes about the second month, normally.</p>


<h3>Shape</h3>

<p>In most cases the head of the infant is more or less compressed
during labor. In hard labor it may be so greatly
compressed that it gives the appearance of being deformed,
but this apparent deformity soon disappears, usually from
the third to the fifth week. Healthy children and especially
good natured ones are sometimes neglected and permitted to
lie in one position for such a length of time that the head
becomes misshapen. Usually in such cases the child is placed
on his back. This results in the flattening of the back of
the head. This, however, may be easily corrected by changing
the position of the child occasionally. These variations
should not be mistaken for actual deformities of the head.</p>


<h3 class="center no-indent">THORAX</h3>

<p>The average chest measurement of the child at birth is
from thirteen to thirteen and four-tenths inches; thus it is
seen that at birth the circumference of the chest is about a
half inch less than that of the head. The circumference of
the abdomen is about equal to that of the chest. The transverse
diameter is practically the same as that of the antero-posterior,
but as time goes on and the child develops, the
transverse diameter increases more rapidly until about ten
years of age when the shape of the thorax becomes about
the same as that of the adult. The diameter of the chest
increases at the rate of about one inch per year until the
average of thirty inches is reached at about the age of fifteen.
During childhood the thorax should be carefully observed for
deformities.</p>

<p>Subluxations in the upper dorsal region may result in
faulty postures, which in turn will result in various deformities<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>
of the thorax. If this faulty posture is not corrected
and the child is permitted to grow into adult life with
the deformity, it can readily be seen that such deformity will
become permanent. In such cases the dorsal subluxation
should be adjusted early in life to overcome the faulty posture.
Innate will then take care of this temporary deviation from
the normal shape of the thorax. Deformities of the thorax
often indicate Pott’s dis-ease, curvatures of the spine, rickets,
emphysema, empyema and cardiac disturbances. In such cases
a very careful analysis should be made and the subluxations
adjusted to remove the cause of the condition to which the
deformity is adaptative.</p>


<h3 class="center no-indent">ABDOMEN</h3>

<p>The abdomen of the infant is very large in comparison
with its proportion in later childhood. Up to about two years
of age the circumference is the same as that of the chest,
after which the chest develops more rapidly and the abdomen
gradually assumes the proportions of the adult. However,
the abdomen remains proportionately large up to the age of
puberty. Unless this fact is recognized by the practitioner,
he may suspect an abnormal enlargement of the abdomen.
There are conditions in which an enlargement of the abdomen
is typical, such as in various intestinal disorders and especially
in rickets. In rickets the abdomen becomes gradually extended
and is known as pot belly, but with this there will
be other symptoms of the dis-ease. If the abdomen seems
abnormally large the chiropractor should carefully analyze the
child to determine whether this is the result of some incoördination
or whether it is simply an idiosyncrasy of the
child.</p>


<h3 class="center no-indent">WALKING</h3>

<p>The age at which children are able to sit alone, stand
and walk, varies greatly. Some infants walk as early as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>
tenth month, while others are as late as the eighteenth month.
The average age at which children are able to walk alone is
from thirteen to fifteen months. Other things being equal,
the age at which a child walks has little significance. The
first voluntarily directed movements of the child occur at
about four months of age, sometimes a little earlier, when
the child begins to make an effort to grasp objects which
he sees about him.</p>

<p>At about four or five months of age the average child is
able to hold the head erect when the body is properly supported.
Between the seventh and eighth month the muscles
have developed sufficiently for the child to sit erect by
himself for a few minutes at a time. From this on, the
child develops the sense of equilibrium very rapidly. Not
later than nine months of age the child will indicate a tendency
to stand and to bear the weight upon the feet. He
may even be able to stand with a little assistance; then, in a
very short time, if placed upon the floor he will show a tendency
to pull himself up by a chair and stand alone. This
is soon followed by the first steps and by the thirteenth month
the child is walking alone freely.</p>

<p>Mechanical devices intended to assist the child in learning
to walk are of little value and may be an actual detriment.
If the child is normal, has the proper care and a reasonable
environment, Nature will put him on his feet at the earliest
possible moment without injury to the delicate structures of
the body. If the child is extremely backward in learning to
walk a careful analysis should be made to determine the reason.
Rickets is a very common cause for backwardness in
children, not only in walking but in other functions as well.
If a child is backward in learning to walk he should not be
urged, but the reason for this backwardness should be sought
out and the cause adjusted.</p>

<p>The age at which the child begins to cut teeth varies
greatly in the different individuals with no apparent reason.
There are twenty deciduous or milk teeth and they make
their appearance in the following order and at an average
time as shown in the data. From six to eight months of age
the lower central incisors appear. The four upper incisors
do not appear until from the seventh to the tenth month;
then the two lower lateral incisors and four anterior molars
come through between the tenth and fourteenth month. From
a year and a half to two years of age the four canines put
in their appearance, and from two years to two and a half
the four posterior molars. This completes the set. By the
time a child is one year of age he should have six teeth; at
the age of one and a half years, twelve teeth; at two years,
sixteen teeth; and by the time he is two and a half years of
age he should have the entire set of twenty. The table below
gives the order in which the deciduous teeth appear and the
approximate time when they may be expected. This time
is subject to great variation. This variation does not necessarily
indicate an abnormality. In some children the teeth
appear much earlier than in others. The appearance of the
first teeth may be as late as the tenth month in perfectly
healthy children. However, if the delay is too great attention
should be given the child.</p>

<p>Normal children cut their teeth without any very severe
symptoms. If the child is below normal, or if there are meric
zones in which the structures are not receiving a sufficient
amount of mental impulses, symptoms will be produced.</p>

<p>At the time of dentition many incoördinations may appear,
not because the process of cutting the teeth produces these
conditions, but because the process requires a great expenditure
of internal energy to produce the eruption of the teeth,
hence at such times the forces of the body are very heavily
drawn upon. The force that might be used in bringing about
adaptation to other conditions must be used in this process.
If the child is normal the growth of the teeth will produce
no more symptoms than the growth of the nails. During the
time teeth are coming through the gums there may be increased
salivation and drooling and a tendency for the child
to chew on the fingers. Irritability and restlessness at night
are very frequent symptoms. It is quite common to have
gastro-intestinal disturbances and especially diarrhea.</p>

<p>In delicate and neurotic children all symptoms may be
greatly exaggerated and may become alarming. There may
be fever and acute indigestion. Diarrhea may become very
severe and the child show marked decrease in weight as a
result. If the child is having difficulty cutting the teeth it
is evident that Innate Intelligence is unable to get the forces
to the periphery. In this case the child should have immediate
chiropractic attention. It is not uncommon for a
temperature to run during the time just before the teeth come
through the gums. In such cases a very careful analysis
should be made and the child adjusted regularly until the
symptoms have disappeared.</p>

<p>In the majority of cases when there is incoördination during
the process of dentition it will be found upon careful
analysis that there are conditions responsible for the symptoms
other than difficult dentition and they are only exaggerated
by the dentition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span></p>

<p>After the teeth have made their appearance care should
be taken that they are kept clean. This may be accomplished
by washing the teeth and mouth.</p>

<p>The eruption of the permanent teeth causes no great disturbance
and there are usually no symptoms connected with
their appearance other than a little discomfort locally. The
appearance of the first permanent teeth do not disturb any
of the temporary teeth, since they develop just posterior to
them. These are the six-year-old molars. Following these
we find the incisors displacing the incisors of the temporary
teeth. Then comes the bicuspids taking the place of the
temporary molars. These are followed by the canines which
displace the canines of the temporary set. The next to appear
are the second and third molars which occupy a place back
of the canines where room has been made by the development
of the jaw.</p>

<p>The following table is given to enable the student to get at
a glance an idea of the approximate age that the different
permanent teeth make their appearance.</p>

<h3>Hygiene of the Teeth</h3>

<p>It should be remembered that these are the teeth that must
serve the child during his entire life and therefore should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>
receive the best of attention. Want of cleanliness is without
doubt responsible for much of the trouble with the teeth of
children. This is especially true among the poorer class of
people and those who do not appreciate the value of proper
personal hygiene. Even before there are any teeth the infant’s
mouth should be washed and properly cleansed, and attention
should be given the teeth as soon as they appear. The child
should be taught early in life that it is very essential that the
teeth be washed and cleaned regularly. Before the child is
old enough to do this the nurse or attendant should do it for
him. Food permitted to remain between the teeth will soon
decompose in the temperature of the mouth, therefore care
should be exercised that all particles of food be removed as
soon as possible. Decomposing food has a very destructive
effect upon the teeth and tends to destroy the enamel due
to the chemical reaction. When there are no subluxations
Innate will bring about an adaptation as far as possible, but
it is impossible to change the reaction of a chemical without
neutralizing it. Undoubtedly Innate does this in many instances,
but it should not be necessary for Innate to do this
extra work when the filth may be removed educationally.</p>

<p>Lack of cleanliness is entirely too prevalent among some
classes of people and it will be found that children who have
not had the proper care of the teeth will suffer more or less
with dental caries. The common belief that many conditions
and incoördinations are caused from the teeth has been proven
erroneous by Chiropractic, but the chiropractor should recognize
the necessity for the proper care of the teeth and when
they are in need of attention the patient should be sent to
a dentist. Poor teeth interferes with mastication and prevents
the food being properly prepared for gastric digestion.
Severe nervous symptoms may arise from toothache.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that proper hygienic methods alone
are not sufficient to preserve the teeth in perfect condition.
The teeth may be kept strictly clean and yet they decay, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>
a result of subluxations causing interference with the transmission
of mental impulses. If the teeth are decaying the
child should be given a thorough analysis and the subluxations
should be adjusted. However, the chiropractor does not
take the place of the dentist. The child should be taken
periodically to the dentist to have the teeth examined and
any defects attended to; likewise he should be taken regularly
to the chiropractor to have his subluxations adjusted.</p>


<h3>Adjustments during Dentition</h3>

<p>Most excellent results may be obtained in difficult dentition
from chiropractic adjustments. The major for the local condition
is M.C.P., but if there are accompanying conditions
such as diarrhea or indigestion, the combination will include
the zones that may be involved. If there are gastric symptoms
then we will include an S.P.; if the intestinal tract is involved
then it will be necessary to adjust a lumbar. There are some
cases that require adjustments at K.P. During dentition the
child should be taken to the chiropractor for an analysis and
should receive adjustments to keep him in a healthful condition.
Certainly it is much better to have the child in perfect
health during the time the teeth are appearing for under
the most favorable conditions the cutting of the teeth is very
trying on the child. The idea that cutting the teeth is responsible
for many abnormal symptoms in children is very
old, but it is now generally conceded that the eruption of the
teeth in the healthy child will cause no disturbance in his
health.</p>

<p class="center no-indent fs120 bold">ANALYZING INFANTS</p>


<p>One of the most baffling situations the chiropractor meets
is in caring for sick babies. There are several reasons for
this: The baby can give no assistance in the way of subjective
symptoms. It is difficult to nerve trace with any degree
of satisfaction and assurance of accuracy; it is even very
difficult to keep the child still for palpation. Therefore, it
becomes necessary to rely largely upon the objective symptoms
and the palpation, with what verification may be obtained
from nerve tracing and the spinograph. However, there is no
class of patients in which the results are so gratifying as with
the babies and small children, for they respond to adjustments
more readily than does the adult.</p>

<p>There is no time in the practice of the chiropractor when
he needs to have better self-control than when he is taking
care of infants. There is great need of every faculty that
is employed in the analyzing and adjusting, especially if the
child is seriously ill. Usually the parents are more or less
excited and worried and are likely to keep urging the chiropractor
to do something and thus unduly influence him unless
he is accustomed to such cases. If the child is in pain and
crying it is likely to get on the nerve of every one present
and this will tend to make the chiropractor nervous. He must
be careful that these things do not influence him to act too
hastily before he has had time to make a careful analysis.</p>


<h3>History of the Case</h3>

<p>Great care must of necessity be exercised in taking the
analysis of the baby and of the small child. A very careful
history should be taken. This, of course, must be obtained
from the parents or nurse. This history should include such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span>
points as whether birth was instrumental or natural, whether
it was premature or full term, whether there were any peculiarities
of respiration at birth, whether there have been any
convulsions and what sickness, if any, the child has suffered
with. Inquiry should be made relative to the condition of the
bowels and kidneys, how the child sleeps, and if there is a
tendency to cry out during sleep. If the child refuses to nurse
or nurses with difficulty it may indicate an incoördination
of the mouth or the throat.</p>


<h3>Objective Symptoms</h3>

<p>In view of the fact that the child can give no aid in the
way of subjective symptoms, it is necessary for the chiropractor
to make most careful observations and substitute, as
far as possible, the objective symptoms for the subjective
ones. About the first thing we see when we begin the analysis
is the baby’s face. It may reveal valuable information. A
very careful study should be made of the facial expression
and the condition of the eyes. In the face we take into consideration
the color. We should look for pallor, cyanosis and
jaundice; we notice whether there is perspiration, whether
the face is cold and clammy or warm and moist; also we
observe the expression as to the muscular condition, since
there may be muscular spasms which will produce grimace.
This is either the result of pain some place in the body or an
abnormal action of the facial muscles. There may be a pinched
expression or a look of fear or anxiety. In some severe cases
the face will be expressionless, while in others it may be that
of an adult.</p>

<p>The condition of the eyes is important. They may have a
dull expressionless look. The lids may droop and the eyeballs
be sunken. In cerebral incoördinations there may be strabismus,
or the eyeballs may be rolled upward and inward.
These symptoms are significant and should all be very carefully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span>
noted, for, as has been stated, there will be no chance
to profit by subjective symptoms.</p>

<p>After a careful observation of the face and facial expression
has been made, the child should be undressed and placed in a
convenient position for further observation. Before the clothing
is removed the room must be heated to a proper temperature
so the infant will not take cold or be exposed to an
atmosphere that will be distressing. A temperature suitable
for the bath will be satisfactory. The child should be placed
on his back and every movement of the body observed. Such
movements as the flexing of the thighs on the abdomen, as
in abdominal pain, may lead the chiropractor to a conclusion
on the zone involved.</p>

<p>The general appearance of the child must be carefully
considered, whether the child is properly developed and
whether or not there are any deformities. The chiropractor
should look for dyspnea and other objective symptoms. A
very careful inspection should be made of the spine to determine
any malformations or marked curvatures. The character
of the cry is sometimes important, as for instance in
pneumonia or bronchitis there is a short, catchy cry; the
cry of laryngitis and croup will be hoarse. In extreme prostration,
as in many cases of malnutrition, the cry will be very
feeble.</p>


<h3>Respiration</h3>

<p>Since the chiropractor must depend almost entirely upon
objective symptoms and upon the palpation of the infant in
determining the character of the incoördination he should be
thoroughly familiar with the characteristics of the normal
child. The rate of respiration of the infant, especially during
sleep, is of some importance. The following table is given
by Holt and Howland and indicates the normal rate of respiration
at different ages:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span></p>


<table class="autotable" style="width: 60%">

</tr>
</table>
<br>

<p>Respiration is very much faster than this when the child
is awake. If the child is at all active it may be twice as fast.
It is advisable to observe the respiration to determine whether
it is normal or labored, shallow or deep, regular or irregular.</p>

<p>Irregularity of respiration in infants is characteristic and
must not be mistaken for indications of incoördination. The
least excitement will disturb the rhythm; as a matter of fact,
the only time there will be perfect rhythm is during sleep.
In observing infants it will be found that the lungs sometimes
do not expand equally. This is due to the delicate muscular
walls of the thorax and does not necessarily indicate incoördination.
It is well to take this into consideration when observing
the infant. This must be very carefully considered when
incoördinations of the lungs are suspected. Placed in certain
positions one lung may expand very much more than the
other in normal respiration; or in some positions, and sometimes
for unknown reasons, there may be practically no expansion
in one lung for a short time. This peculiarity is due to
the inability of Innate to maintain adaptation through the
delicate structures of the thorax to the atmospheric pressure.
This might be very misleading and result in the conclusion
that one lung was badly affected when there would be nothing
at all wrong. However, if there are symptoms which indicate
an incoördination in the lungs there should be a very
careful palpation made of the upper dorsal region to locate
the subluxation and the hot box.</p>

<p>In infants the respiration is altogether diaphragmatic; it
is irregular at times; it may be superficial for a time and
then deep. This irregularity continues in the child more or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span>
less until the seventh year. After this such an irregularity
indicates some disturbance and should receive consideration.</p>

<p>The muscular walls of the thorax are very feebly developed
and are therefore very soft and yielding; a slight obstruction
in respiration will result in a marked sinking of the thorax
from the normal atmospheric air pressure.</p>


<h3>Pulse Rate</h3>

<p>It is not necessary to take the pulse of the infant, but
it might be well to know what the normal pulse rate is at
different ages. The following table will give the desired
information:</p>
<br>

<table class="autotable" style="width: 75%">

<td class="tdl">At birth the pulse rate is from</td>

</table>
<br>

<p>Very slight disturbances will often increase the pulse rate
out of all proportion to the severity of the condition. The
heart will beat very much faster just from the handling of
the child in making the analysis, or as a result of any excitement
or crying. It may be very difficult to count the pulse
because of its rapidity.</p>

<p>Often a very moderate incoördination will result in a
marked increase in the pulse rate and especially is this true
in cases in which there is slight fever.</p>

<p>An increase of the heart action does not, necessarily, mean
that heart place should be adjusted. This increased action
may be due to the natural adaptation because of handling or
to nervousness at the presence of strangers. Especially is this
likely to be true of the child that is old enough to notice things.
It is not uncommon to have the pulse beat increased as much
as 25 beats per minute in this way.</p>

<p>During sleep the pulse may be slightly irregular, even when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span>
the child is normal. In cerebral disturbances it will be slow
and irregular. In cerebral tumor it may be as slow as 40 or
50 beats per minute. In acute incoördinations the pulse rate
may be very greatly increased. With incoördinations in such
families as the poison, fever, degeneration, and some incoördinations
in the spasms family, the pulse rate may be very high,
even when the condition is not at all alarming. It is well to
take this into consideration when observing a case so that
the chiropractor will not be misled in making the analysis
and that the objective symptoms may be of greatest value
to him.</p>


<h3>Zones Involved</h3>

<p>In analyzing an infant it is well to keep in mind the zones
in which incoördination is most commonly found. In the
majority of cases these zones will include the gastro-intestinal
tract, the respiratory tract, the kidney zones and the brain.
Very frequently there will be incoördinations of the pharynx,
tonsils and mouth.</p>

<p>The incoördinations found in the digestive tract will include
all forms of indigestion and dysentery. Such incoördinations
as pneumonia and bronchitis will involve the respiratory
tract. From the kidneys there are the various conditions involving
the poison family due to improper elimination. Meningitis
and all forms of cerebral incoördinations as well as
conditions of the eyes and ears are common to infancy and
childhood.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that with an infant grave symptoms
may develop in a very short time, likewise recovery may take
place very quickly following even the most alarming symptoms.
However, no chances should be taken for it is not
uncommon for an infant previously in good health to become
sick very suddenly and die within a few hours. Therefore,
in handling children most careful attention should be given
and conditions should always be regarded more or less serious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span>
until developments prove otherwise. The chiropractor must
realize that his success in handling infants does not depend
entirely upon his observations of the case, for with every
patient there must be a thorough and complete analysis of
the spine. The only value to be received from the observations
is that they may lead him to specific regions of the
spine.</p>


<h3>The Child’s Cry</h3>

<p>It is not uncommon for an infant to cry with no apparent
localized cause. This crying may continue for hours with no
other symptoms. There will be no indication of colic or other
symptoms to denote the seat of the pain. The crying is constant
and, while in some cases may be quite violent, yet there
are no paroxysmal attacks; this indicates that the pain is constant.
It is easily distinguished from a hunger cry in that the
child usually refuses to nurse. If the crying persists for hours
there will be more or less exhaustion. Such cases are very
pitiful and draw heavily upon the sympathies of the chiropractor
as well as upon other attendants. In such cases the first
thing to do is to strip the infant of all clothing and look for
open safety pins, rough places in the clothing, such as folds or
wrinkles; foreign objects, as small buttons, for example.
Usually, however, this will be done before the chiropractor
is called. It may be an advantage for the chiropractor to
observe the infant very carefully for a few minutes after the
clothing has been removed, in an effort to locate the seat of
the pain. However, this is not so very important because
first, in most of these cases it is practically impossible to
determine the location of pain, and second, because a very
careful palpation of the child will always reveal the causative
subluxation. In making the analysis the chiropractor should
give himself plenty of time to make a thorough palpation.
He should not be in too great a hurry to adjust the child
merely because of his anxiety to relieve the crying. He must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span>
not allow the incessant crying of the child to work upon his
nerve and destroy his efficiency in caring for the patient. In
these cases the subluxation may be located in any part of
the spine, although it is less often found in the cervical region.
If there is a subluxation in the cervical region, great enough
to produce this constant crying, there is very likely to be
cerebral symptoms. In these cases the subluxations are usually
quite exaggerated and very often the hot box becomes the
determining factor.</p>

<p>In a case recently an infant three weeks old had been
crying constantly for several hours. The clothing had been
removed and the child very carefully bathed and powdered;
then instead of the clothing being replaced the child was
wrapped in a blanket. Still the crying persisted. A very
careful observation of the patient gave no information whatsoever
as to the possible location of the cause for the crying.
There was nothing that would quiet the child. He finally
grew so exhausted that the cry became little more than a
whimper, beads of perspiration standing out over the entire
body. There were no signs of colic or tympanites. A careful
palpation revealed the sixth dorsal very badly subluxated and
a slight subluxation of the first lumbar. These were adjusted
and the child stopped crying almost instantly and in less
than ten minutes was sleeping normally. There was no return
of the abnormal crying and the child had no further adjustments.</p>

<p>We have many such cases on record, but the citation of
this one is sufficient to illustrate the results that are obtained
in such cases.</p>


<h3>Palpating the Infant</h3>

<p>In palpating an infant the first thing to look for is the hot
box. It may be possible to locate it very easily and if this
is so it then becomes necessary only to list the direction
in which the vertebra is subluxated. In looking for the hot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span>
box it is necessary to use care so as not to be misled by the
difference in the temperature of the back due to some article
of clothing being in contact with the back and raising the
temperature in that region. Notice that there has not been
some woolen garment, such as the band, pressing against the
spine. To eliminate the possibility of thus being misled the
entire back should be exposed to the atmosphere a sufficient
length of time to allow the back to become influenced alike
to the temperature of the air. The majority of incoördinations
of infancy are acute, therefore the hot box is present. After
the hot box is located then a very careful palpation should
be made to determine the direction in which the vertebra is
subluxated. It is not sufficient to consider that because the
patient is an infant all that is necessary is to list the vertebra
straight posterior and adjust it accordingly. Laterality,
superiority and inferiority are quite as essential, and the chiropractor
should not be satisfied until he has convinced himself
on the question of these directions. If there is no laterality,
superiority or inferiority then the adjustment should be given
straight toward the anterior.</p>

<p>In palpating an infant it is usually best to place the child
on the knees of an adult in the position for an adjustment.
The child will be almost constantly on the move. It will
therefore be necessary for the chiropractor to adapt himself
to this constant moving. The child should be placed in as
many different positions as possible to make the palpation.
He may be held up over the shoulder of the mother or nurse;
first on one side, then on the other, this giving opportunity
to palpate with both hands and make comparisons.</p>

<p>No effort should be made to force the child to be still. It is
a good policy to hold the palpating fingers on the spine and
let the child wiggle and squirm all he wants to, moving the
spine beneath the palpating fingers of the chiropractor. In
this way a comparison may be made of what is felt under
the fingers while the child is moving.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span></p>

<p>It is quite difficult to nerve trace an infant in any measure
of accuracy because the infant can not coöperate to any degree
of satisfaction. In some, however, nerve tracing may be used
to a certain extent by producing slight pressure and noticing
whether or not the child flinches.</p>

<p>It is very much more difficult to palpate the cervical vertebrae
of an infant than it is those of the dorsal and lumbar
regions. The same technique and tactics are used, however.
It is sometimes an advantage to place the child on the mother’s
lap in such a way that the head will be unsupported by the lap.
One hand should support the child’s forehead, while the other
hand palpates or it may be necessary to place the infant in
some other position. The chiropractor should be sufficiently
resourceful to find a way to get an accurate palpation of the
cervical region. Here, again, he will meet with the difficulty
of keeping the child still. This makes it necessary that he be
very alert and at the instant it is possible to feel the vertebra
to be ready to make his comparisons quickly and decide the
direction in which it is subluxated.</p>

<p>The cervical vertebrae of an infant are very hard to feel,
but if one of the segments is subluxated sufficiently to cause
pressure on a nerve that segment will be easier to feel because
it is out of the median line; especially will it be easier to
feel if it is subluxated posteriorly. Every possible means
must be used to make an accurate palpation. If there is a subluxation
in the cervical region there will very likely be symptoms
which will indicate it. Subluxations are not as commonly
found in the cervical region as in the other regions of
the spine.</p>

<p>In making an analysis of the infant the importance of the
sacrum must not be overlooked. It will be remembered that
the segments of the child’s sacrum are separated with cartilage
and are subject to being subluxated. These segments coalesce
later in adolescence and form the sacrum into one solid bone.
Therefore it is highly important that the subluxations that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span>
may exist between the segments be adjusted before this process
takes place.</p>

<p>The tubercular ridge formed by the rudimentary spinous
process in the median line of the posterior surface of the
sacrum is of very little value in palpating the segments of
the sacrum. It is best to palpate the articular crest on each
side of the tubercular ridge. In this way it is possible to
determine if one segment is more prominent on one side than
on the other. This should be done very carefully and if a
subluxation is found it should be adjusted on the side that
is most prominent. The contact is on the articular ridge and
the thumb may be used for nail point the same as in the dorsal
region; or if the child is large enough nail point one may
be used.</p>

<p>Whenever possible a spinograph should be made of the
child. This may not always be possible with the small child
and with the very young infant it may be very difficult. In
many acute incoördinations it is impracticable to try to get
a spinograph, not because the spinograph would not be of
value, but because it is difficult to get to the office to take it.
In the chronic cases a spinograph should by all means be
taken. Every possible means should be used to verify the
palpation.</p>

<p class="center no-indent">CHAPTER IV</p>
</div>

<p class="center no-indent fs120 bold">ADJUSTING INFANTS</p>


<p>The recoil is used in adjusting a child the same as in
adjusting an adult. The young infant can be placed upon the
knees of the mother or nurse instead of being placed on an
adjusting table. The ordinary adjusting table will be too
large for the real small infant. Care must be used that the
child is placed in the correct position for the adjustment and
that the neck and head are properly supported. Placing the
child on a pillow on the lap of an adult is not satisfactory
because the pillow is too soft and makes it more difficult to
move the vertebrae. If the child is adjusted on the mother’s
lap care must be exercised that the mother’s skirt is not
drawn tightly for it is best to leave the infant’s abdomen
unsupported or at least not to have too solid a support.</p>

<p>When the mother holds the babe on her lap there is a
tendency for her to raise her heel off the floor so as to make
the knee supporting the child’s head higher than the other.
When the adjustment is given the knee will not be sufficiently
solid to support the child and the vertebra will not move.
For this reason the chiropractor must see that the mother’s
heels are both placed squarely on the floor. It is a good plan
after the contact has been taken and the chiropractor is ready
to give the adjustment to ask if both heels are on the floor.
Nine times out of ten one heel will be lifted and the toe will
be supporting the weight of the child.</p>

<p>In adjusting small infants in the dorsal and lumbar regions
the side of the thumb may be used for nail point. In getting
the contact one should palpate in the usual manner, find the
vertebra that is to be adjusted, remove all fingers except the
pointer finger, turn the hand so the finger is parallel with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</span>
the child’s spine, then instead of placing the pisiform bone
of the nail hand, place the side of the thumb in exactly the
same manner as if it was nail point one. This being done,
remove the pointer finger. Then instead of placing the hammer
hand on the nail hand as in using the pisiform bone for
nail point, grasp the thumb that is being used for nail point
between the thumb and finger of the hammer hand and press
the tissues tightly to make the side of the nail thumb firm.
The thrust is given with a recoil just the same as in the usual
manner.</p>

<p>It is best not to use too much force until it is determined
just the amount required to move the vertebra. One will be
surprised, however, at the amount of force required to move
the vertebrae of a very small infant. It should be remembered
that the vertebrae must move if we expect to get results.
It must also be remembered that the child is small and that
it is necessary to adapt the amount of force used to the size
of the patient. It is not possible to injure a child with a
chiropractic adjustment, but it is possible to apply an awkward
force, supposed to be a corrective force, in such a way
that subluxations may be produced.</p>

<p>This method will be used only with the smallest infants.
When the child is a few months old the pisiform bone may
be used in exactly the same manner as with the adult. The
only difference is that the amount of force will be suited to
the size of the patient. In case a straight posterior subluxation
and a double transverse adjustment is given on a single
vertebra the adjuster may use his two fingers, the first and
second, to get contact on the transverse processes. The nail
hand is then placed across the two fingers and the adjustment
is given with the recoil. It will require very little force
to move a vertebra of an infant on the transverse processes.</p>

<p>Care must be exercised that the neck is properly supported
when an adjustment in the cervical region is given. It
is best to place the child on an infant’s adjusting table whenever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</span>
possible. When this is impracticable the child may be
placed on the lap of an adult the same as for an adjustment
in the other regions of the spine. If the head is allowed to
remain unsupported as is so often the case when larger babies
are adjusted in this manner, there is danger of moving something
that should not be moved when the adjustment is made.
Therefore that part of the neck directly beneath the vertebra
to be adjusted must be placed solidly on the mother’s knee.
The same technique is used with older patients in that the
face is turned in the direction of the laterality of the subluxation
to be adjusted.</p>

<p>With the small infant it may be difficult or even impossible
to get nail point two in position to adjust, especially in the
middle cervical region. In this event the side of the first
finger may be used to an advantage. This will be used, however,
only with the smallest infants. In using nail point two
it will be an advantage to get the contact near the distal end
of the fifth metacarpal bone instead of at the center as in
using nail point two on an adult. In adjusting the atlas and
axis it is very easy to get the contact with nail point two
in the usual manner.</p>

<p>The cervical vertebrae of the infant are very small and
extreme care must be exercised in adjusting. Sufficient force
must be used to move the vertebra.</p>

<p>The importance of proper attention to adjusting the segments
of the sacrum of the infant and small child can not be
overestimated. During childhood the child is subject to many
falls and jars which are likely to be centered upon the sacrum.
These segments being separated by cartilage are relatively
easily subluxated. If they become subluxated in youth incoördinations
may develop, which in later life will result in
various degrees of discomfort or even defects which will
become permanent and for which nothing can be done. There
are many conditions in adult life which are without doubt the
result of pressure upon sacral nerve and this pressure can not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</span>
be released because of the inability to move the subluxated
segments after they become coalesced.</p>

<p>Many deformities and incoördinations in these zones could
be averted by proper attention to the segments of the sacrum
during childhood. When parents realize the importance of
this they will take their children to their chiropractor periodically
to have the sacrum as well as the rest of the spinal
column palpated. Then the subluxations that have been produced
will be taken care of before they become chronic and
more difficult to correct.</p>

<p>A careful palpation of the segments of the sacrum should
be made. The most common subluxation is a rotation
resulting in that segment being more prominent on one side
than on the other. When a segment is found to be posterior
on one side the adjuster should stand on the opposite side
and palpate in the usual manner finding the tubercle of the
segment subluxated, measuring to a point midway between
the tubercle and the ilium with the second finger of the
palpating hand. This finger should then be replaced with the
second finger of the opposite hand and the pisiform bone of
the palpating hand should be used for nail point. If the
patient is a very small infant do not change nail hands but
use the thumb of the usual nail hand and adjust the same as
adjusting a dorsal or lumbar vertebra when using the thumb
for nail point.</p>

<p class="center no-indent">CHAPTER V</p>
</div>

<p class="center no-indent fs120 bold">RESPIRATORY SYSTEM</p>


<p>Children and infants are subject to the same general class
of dis-eases as are adults and there are no dis-eases which
are particularly peculiar to childhood. The incoördinations
are not peculiar but rather the children as patients are peculiar.
The incoördinations of the child’s respiratory system are practically
the same as those affecting the respiratory system of
the adult but there are certain peculiarities of the patient that
should be considered. Our work will be principally the consideration
of these peculiarities rather than the incoördinations
themselves. It is not our thought to produce a work on
symptomatology.</p>


<h3 class="center no-indent">ACUTE NASAL CATARRH</h3>

<p>This is also called coryza, cold in the head and acute
rhinopharyngitis. It is a very common condition in infants
and small children and one that is readily recognized and
easily handled chiropractically. It is very essential that we
be able to distinguish between a simple acute nasal catarrh
and the coryza which accompanies such conditions as measles,
influenza, and nasal diphtheria. If in these conditions there
is profuse discharge tinged with blood for two or three weeks,
nasal diphtheria should be suspected, even though there are
no other very serious symptoms. With a very young infant
a persistent acute nasal catarrh may indicate syphilis. In such
a case, a careful watch should be kept for more positive
symptoms.</p>


<h3>Symptoms</h3>

<p>The onset may be more or less sudden with sneezing and
a slight fever. There is a profuse discharge from the nose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</span>
in severe cases which at first is seromucous and later becomes
mucopurulent. The mucous membrane is red and swollen.
The equation for the mucous membrane is calorific plus and
N.C.R. for the mucopurulent discharge. In severe cases there
may be a temperature of 103° F. to 105° F. with marked
constitutional disturbances. In the mild cases the symptoms
will be less severe and many times very transient.</p>

<p>Results are obtained very quickly with acute nasal catarrh
or coryza and when the adjustment is given at the beginning
of the symptoms there will be no complications. However, if
the condition is allowed to run until it has gained momentum,
longer time will be required for results and there may be distressing
complications. If the condition is not corrected at
once the throat may become involved and even the bronchi,
which may develop into bronchopneumonia. Retropharyngeal
abscesses may also develop. Nasal catarrh may continue
until it becomes chronic.</p>


<h3>Equation</h3>

<p>Primarily the equation in nasal catarrh is M-. In the
capillaries of the mucous membrane lining the nasal passages
this results in hyperemia of the blood vessels and exudation.
This results in C+ in the mucous membrane. The exudation
which at first is a colorless fluid soon becomes mucopurulent
from the C+ so the equation for the exudation becomes N.C.R.</p>


<h3>Family</h3>

<p>The family for the C+ condition in the mucous membrane
is fever family, while the N.C.R. condition is in the degenerations
family. The products of the degeneration may produce
symptoms in the poison family.</p>


<h3>Adjustment</h3>

<p>The major adjustment for acute nasal catarrh is M.C.P.
and K.P.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</span></p>

<p>Conditions of this kind are sometimes aggravated by the
care which the child receives at the hands of a careless mother.
She may keep the child too warm or not warm enough. Often
a child is dressed so warmly that the least exertion will cause
profuse perspiration. Then the child “takes cold” because of
the inability of Innate Intelligence to bring about an intellectual
adaptation in so short a time. An infant may be and
should be kept very warm, but as the child grows older he
should be allowed sufficient freedom, especially in the summer
time, to permit of exercise and yet not become too warm.</p>

<p>The hygienic measures to be used are attention to the
sleeping rooms, which should be properly ventilated, always
having plenty of air at night, and the house temperature
during the day. This should be from 65°F to 68°F.</p>


<h3 class="center no-indent">FOREIGN BODIES LODGED IN THE NOSE</h3>

<p>Children often in their play will place such foreign bodies
as peas, beans, buttons, beads and other small objects in their
noses. These set up a mechanical irritation and produce
swelling of the mucous membrane and often pain. If the
object remains for any length of time there is likely to be
a profuse discharge of a mucopurulent character. If there is
such a discharge from only one, nostril special attention should
be given to determine the presence of any foreign body and
if there be one the child should be taken to a surgeon at once.
If the discharge continues following the removal it will be
due to a subluxation at M.C.P., which is interfering with the
transmission of mental impulses preventing normal adaptation
and reparation taking place. This should be adjusted. However,
if there are no subluxations the injury which was done
by the mechanical obstruction will be repaired in a short
time.</p>


<h3 class="center no-indent">CHRONIC NASAL CATARRH</h3>

<p>Chronic nasal catarrh, also called chronic rhinitis, is a
chronic inflammation of the mucous membrane lining the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</span>
nasal passages and pharynx. There may be structural changes
take place resulting in injury to the organs of smell, taste,
hearing, speech and respiration.</p>


<h3>Symptoms</h3>

<p>The mucous membrane becomes congested and swollen.
There is a constant mucous or mucopurulent discharge from
the nose. The air passages may be partially or completely
closed. If the child is old enough the nose may be easily
freed from this discharge by blowing. If the child is not old
enough to do this great inconvenience and discomfort will be
experienced. The upper lip may become irritated, swollen and
permanently enlarged and prominent from the constant blowing
and wiping the nose. The excretion produces a constant
irritation. There is a marked tendency on the part of the
child to constantly pick at the nose; this tends to increase
the irritation both of the nose and the upper lip. Usually
there are adenoid growths, which will produce mouth breathing
and may interfere with the function of hearing. A very
marked characteristic is the inclination for the child to continually
snuffle.</p>

<p>If the condition is allowed to remain for a long time without
adjustments, ulcerations may occur on the mucous membrane;
the discharge from this will be very offensive. In the
atrophic form ozena is very common. Ozena is a very fetid
discharge from the nasal cavity associated with ulcerations
which may involve the bones of the nose.</p>


<h3>Equation</h3>

<p>The equation is the same as the acute form with the exception
that the N.C.R. condition becomes more prominent.</p>


<h3>Family</h3>

<p>Same as the acute form except that the degenerations
family takes precedence over the other families involved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</span></p>


<h3>Major Adjustment</h3>

<p>The adjustment is the acute condition—M.C.P. and K.P.
A greater length of time will be required, however, than in
the acute stage, but the prognosis is always good. In caring
for a child in this condition the parents and attendants should
exercise care that there is no unnecessary irritation of the
nose and local parts. The nose should be kept clean and as
soft a handkerchief as possible used in wiping the nose. During
the process of retracing discharge from the nose will pass
through practically the same stages as during the progress
from the acute stage. The process is just reversed. The
scabs that form in the nose now begin to soften and the discharge
continues to change until it becomes as it was in the
beginning of the acute stage in a thin watery discharge.
Finally the discharge ceases entirely and the child is well.</p>


<h3 class="center no-indent">EPISTAXIS</h3>

<p>Nose bleed does not often occur in infants but is quite
common during childhood. It is the result of interference
with the transmission of motor mental impulses to the muscular
walls of the capillaries of the nose. Epistaxis may
result from a fall or blow on the nose. It occurs as an early
symptom of different incoördinations such as typhoid fever
and measles; as a matter of fact, it occurs in the hemorrhagic
form of all eruptive fevers, in some cases of diphtheria, and
in dis-eases of the heart and blood vessels.</p>

<p>Epistaxis is often considered of little consequence, but it
may be a very serious condition and even result in death.
It is especially serious when occurring in infants.</p>


<h3>Equation</h3>

<p>The equation for epistaxis is M. There is a relaxation of
the muscular walls of the capillaries resulting in the hemorrhage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</span></p>


<h3>Family</h3>

<p>Epistaxis is in the prolapsis family due to the relaxation
of the muscular fibers in the walls of the capillaries.</p>


<h3>Adjustment</h3>

<p>The adjustment for epistaxis is M.C.P., and in most cases
this is fourth cervical. In some cases the results come instantly.
The prognosis is always good when the proper
adjustment is given.</p>


<h2>INCOÖRDINATIONS OF THE LARYNX</h2>


<h3 class="center no-indent">CROUP</h3>

<p>Croup is an inflammation of the larynx characterized by
a more or less severe spasm of the laryngeal muscles. This
spasmodic contraction distinguishes it from similar affections
in adults. The spasm produced is very often more marked
and results in more severe symptoms than does the inflammation.
This incoördination is also called spasmodic laryngitis
and catarrhal croup.</p>


<h3>Symptoms</h3>

<p>In spasmodic laryngitis or croup there is a slight catarrhal
inflammation of the mucous membrane lining the larynx and
a marked spasm of the larynx. There may be a slight discharge
from the nose and slight hoarseness. The attacks
usually come on at night with a hollow, metallic cough. About
this time there is difficult breathing and the cough becomes
more severe and of a teasing nature, the child making every
possible effort to keep from coughing. The voice becomes
husky but is seldom lost. There is rapid pulse and a slight
temperature seldom over 101° F. The attack lasts three or
four hours, after which the child will fall asleep. The dyspnea
is aggravated and the spasm increased by excitement. During<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</span>
the day the child will appear well except for the slight cough
and hoarseness, but the second night the attack will return
with about the same degree of severity as that of the first
night. Usually the attack may not return the third night or
if it does it will be less severe.</p>

<p>Spasmodic laryngitis should not be confused with laryngismus
stridulus, membraneous croup or with acute catarrhal
laryngitis. According to Holt and Howland laryngismus
stridulus occurs only in infants, and there is not only stridulous
breathing, but also periods of complete arrest of respiration.</p>


<h3>Major Adjustment</h3>

<p>Lower cervical and S.P. is the combination major to use
in this incoördination. Under adjustments results are often
obtained immediately with no recurrence of the attack the
following night.</p>

<p>In chronic cases enlarged tonsils and adenoid growths may
be found. This, however, will not change the adjustment or
the combination, but will increase the amount of time required
to completely correct the condition so far as the chronicity
is concerned. It will not interfere with the relief from
acute attacks.</p>


<h3 class="center no-indent">LARYNGISMUS STRIDULUS</h3>

<p>This incoördination, according to Holt and Howland, occurs
only in infancy. It is characterized by muscular spasms in
the larynx with marked dyspnea.</p>


<h3>Symptoms</h3>

<p>There may be complete arrest of respiration for short
periods, during which there will also be a marked lack of
oxygenation of the blood. There may be recurrence of these
attacks several times a day, and unless adjustments are given
may last for weeks. There may be general convulsions and
carpopedal spasms which are spasmodic contractions of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</span>
joints of the hands and feet. During the periods of arrested
breathing the face becomes cyanosed. This terminates with
a slight cough or a high-pitched crowing sound produced by
the sudden inspiration of air. Because of this it is sometimes
called “child crowing.” It is also known as thymic asthma
and spasms of the glottis.</p>

<h3><b>Major Adjustment</b></h3>

<p>The combination major is lower cervical and stomach place.
Under adjustments results are obtained in a very short time,
in many cases almost instantly.</p>


<h3 class="center no-indent">ACUTE CATARRHAL LARYNGITIS</h3>

<p>This incoördination is found in children from one to five
years of age. It may be severe and even cause death. It
may be a secondary condition following measles, scarlet fever,
influenza and other like incoördinations; however, it may result
directly and not be associated with any other condition.
It is often aggravated by inhaling steam, gases or irritating
dusts.</p>

<p>There is congestion and inflammation of the mucous membrane
lining the larynx; there is swelling and dryness of the
membrane followed by an exudate which may become profuse.
If the swelling is exaggerated there will be stenosis of the
larynx. The vocal cords become swollen and produce aphonia.</p>


<h3>Symptoms</h3>

<p>The symptoms are hoarseness, dry metallic cough, which
may become very severe and teasing. The onset is sudden
with a marked tendency to cough, especially during the night.
The voice often is entirely lost and the larynx becomes sore
and painful. There is dyspnea and the respirations are short
and shallow.</p>

<p>In some cases which develop more slowly there will be
coryza for a day or two preceding the severe attack, or the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</span>
laryngeal symptoms may precede the acute symptoms. The
onset, however, may be very rapid and the most severe symptoms
be present within a very few hours after the manifestation
of the first symptom. In the well developed, case the
cough is dry, metallic, barking and stridulus. The inspiration
is labored. The dyspnea is severe, occurring in paroxysms
during the night. There is temperature, rapid pulse and increased
respiration. If the inflammation extends down into
the bronchi it will result in bronchopneumonia. Laryngeal
obstruction may occur often and prove very severe.</p>

<p>It is sometimes very difficult and in some cases impossible
to distinguish acute catarrhal laryngitis from membranous
laryngitis or laryngeal diphtheria. This is not so important
to the chiropractor, for if adjustments are given soon enough
results will be obtained before positive diagnostic symptoms
have time to develop. However, it is well to be thoroughly
informed on the difference in the symptoms since the chiropractor
is sometimes not called in until the condition is well
under way. At the onset the two conditions are very much
alike, which is very reasonable to the chiropractor, since the
only difference is in degree of severity, due to a different
combination, and a difference in degree of the functions involved
resulting from the same combination o£ subluxations.
In the catarrhal condition the temperature is usually greater
than in the membranous form. The dyspnea in catarrhal
laryngitis is usually paroxysmal; it is less exaggerated during
the day but worse at night, while the membranous
type is constant and rapidly becomes more exaggerated. The
dyspnea occurs on both inspiration and expiration, while in
the catarrhal form it occurs only on inspiration. If the culture
shows Klebs-Loeffler bacilli it is considered laryngeal diphtheria.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</span></p>


<h3>Major Adjustment</h3>

<p>As has been stated, the chiropractor gives the same adjustment
whether it is membranous or catarrhal. The major combination
is L.C. and S.P. with K.P. Excellent results are
obtained from adjustments in these cases. When the first
symptoms are manifest adjustments should be given immediately
in order to get the best results. The usual difficulty
in such cases is that the parents consider the condition only
a cold and of little importance. Therefore, they neglect taking
the child to a chiropractor until great momentum has developed.
Such cases necessitate a greater amount of time
before results are obtained.</p>


<h3 class="center no-indent">CHRONIC LARYNGITIS</h3>

<p>This form is simply a prolongation of the acute form, but
may be associated with adenoid growths of the pharynx, with
tuberculosis of the larynx, with syphilis or with new growths
in the larynx.</p>


<h3>Symptoms</h3>

<p>The symptoms are similar to those in the acute stage
except they are not so severe.</p>

<p>It is not uncommon to find adenoid growths in the pharynx
of the very young infant. There is a superficial inflammation
of the mucous membrane producing a local calorific plus. This
is the result of interference with transmission of mental impulses
to these tissues and when this interference is removed
Innate Intelligence will function normally and the growths
will disappear.</p>


<h3>Major Adjustment</h3>

<p>The adjustment is the same as in the case of acute laryngitis.
The results will be slower in the chronic case than in
the acute case, but in the course of time the child will be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</span>
entirely relieved of the condition without the aid of surgery.
If the proper adjustment is given during the acute attack the
condition will never reach the chronic state.</p>

<p>A chronic laryngitis is often accompanied by papillomatous
growths which occur very early in life, in most cases during
the first year. This condition occurs more often in boys than
in girls. The size and location of the growths determine the
severity of the symptoms. There is paroxysmal cough,
dyspnea, loss of voice, and hoarseness. The symptoms usually
develop so slowly that they do not attract attention until the
growth has attained quite a size. Holt states that the prognosis
is usually serious from a surgical standpoint because
there is danger of bronchopneumonia following the operation.
It is also stated that operations have been largely given up
because of the tendency of the papilloma to return in increasing
numbers. These tumors are the result of the interference
with transmission of mental impulses to the tissues, preventing
the normal personification of Innate Intelligence in the production
of function. Under adjustments which results in the
restoration of the normal transmission excellent results are
obtained. In the course of time under adjustments the growths
will disappear and with them all the symptoms of the chronic
laryngitis. Adjustments should be given just as soon as the
growths are suspected and kept up until the symptoms have
disappeared.</p>


<h3 class="center no-indent">TUBERCULAR LARYNGITIS</h3>

<p>Tubercular laryngitis is seldom found in infants and is
rare even in later childhood. Usually pulmonary tuberculosis
develops later; by some it is considered to be always associated
with it. There is cough and hoarseness with aphonia,
expectoration of mucopurulent or in some instances bloody
character. Microscopic examination of the sputum reveals
the tubercle bacilli. Results are obtained under adjustments,
providing a sufficient amount of time is allowed to permit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</span>
Innate to overcome the momentum and rebuild the structures
that have been destroyed.</p>


<h3 class="center no-indent">FOREIGN BODIES IN LARYNX AND BRONCHI</h3>

<p>Children are likely to acquire the habit of putting small
objects, such as buttons, small playthings, and even pins,
into their mouths. If the child becomes frightened, tries to
cough, laugh or cry that which is held in the mouth at the time
is likely to be drawn into the larynx and may lodge there,
especially if it is sharp or has rough edges. If, however, it
is a smooth object, such as a button or bean, it is more likely
to pass into the bronchi, usually the right one.</p>

<p>When the foreign body enters the larynx there will be
violent coughing which may result in the expulsion of the
object. If it is not immediately expelled but becomes impacted
in the larynx there will be marked dyspnea and even
death from suffocation.</p>

<p>When the foreign body passes the larynx it will lodge,
usually, in one of the bronchi or at the bifurcation of the
trachea. If this occurs there will be localized pain over the
region of the foreign body. There is a cough and may be
spitting of blood. The irritation will result in a local inflammation;
this may result in the formation of an abscess which
may prove serious. In some cases following such conditions
there is prolonged illness resembling pulmonary tuberculosis
during which there may be sufficient relaxation in the muscular
walls of the bronchi to permit the foreign body being expelled
during a paroxysm of coughing. This has occurred in many
cases. Following the expulsion of the foreign body the patient
recovers very rapidly. In some cases there are repeated
attacks of pneumonia. The health of the child becomes greatly
impaired and thus he becomes easily susceptible to the acute
attacks which may prove too much for the adaptability of
the body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</span></p>


<h3>Symptoms</h3>

<p>The symptoms of a foreign body in the larynx are characteristic
and consists in the very sudden appearance of the
attacks and also in the severity of the symptoms. There will
be a history of something having been in the child’s mouth,
or the possibility of the child having placed some object in
his mouth. A metallic body can always be located by means
of the X-ray.</p>

<p>Ordinarily these cases do not come within the scope of
Chiropractic. There might be a subluxation which would
prevent adaptation from taking place, and if so, an adjustment
might result in a relaxation of the muscles to such an
extent that the foreign body could be expelled by coughing.
These cases are traumatic and should be taken to a competent
surgeon at once.</p>


<h3 class="center no-indent">EDEMA OF THE GLOTTIS</h3>

<p>This is a dropsical condition of the glottis and is very rare
in infancy or early childhood. Usually there will be other
symptoms indicating abnormality of the kidneys.</p>


<h3>Symptoms</h3>

<p>If the edema is great enough there will be attacks of
suffocation because of the interference with inspiration. There
is very little if any interference with expiration. There may
be hoarseness, painful and difficult swallowing and a cough.
The symptoms may come on suddenly and develop very
rapidly and soon result fatally.</p>


<h3>Equation and Major Adjustment</h3>

<p>The equation for the local condition is secretion plus (T+).
If the condition is involved with nephritis the equation for the
nephritis is calorific plus (C+) in the kidneys with N.C.R. in
suppurative nephritis, which results in excretion minus (E-).
The major adjustment is K.P. with S.P. and local L.C.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</span></p>


<h2>INCOÖRDINATIONS OF THE LUNGS</h2>


<h3 class="center no-indent">GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS</h3>

<p>The thorax of the infant is shaped somewhat different from
that of the adult, being more cylindrical, the antero-posterior
being nearly the same as the transverse diameter. The transverse
diameter begins to increase about the third year and
this continues until puberty when the typical conical or dome-shaped
thorax is attained.</p>

<p>In the infant and young child the walls of the thorax are
exceedingly yielding and elastic. This is because the greater
portion is made up of cartilaginous tissue before the completed
ossification of the bony structures has taken place.</p>

<p>The thoracic muscles are imperfectly developed. This
makes the thoracic walls very thin. In well nourished infants
the walls are made thicker by the abundance of fat which is
found deposited on them. The diaphragm is very high in the
infant and this greatly decreases the capacity of the thorax
as well as does the frequent distention of the stomach and
intestinal tract because of the accumulation of gas. The
trachea and bronchi of the infant are comparatively larger
than in the adult, the air cells are much smaller, and for this
reason a slight acute congestion will interfere almost as much
with their function as will hepatization. This necessitates immediate
action in all conditions which involve the respiratory
tract, and especially those which affect the lungs or bronchi.
In all such cases results are obtained very quickly under
adjustments. In the child there is a greater tendency for the
inflammation to spread in the lung tissue than in an adult.</p>


<h3 class="center no-indent">ACUTE CATARRHAL BRONCHITIS</h3>

<p>There is probably no one acute incoördination affecting
infants and children that is so common as acute catarrhal
bronchitis, commonly called cold in the chest. During the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</span>
cold months, and especially in the late winter and early spring,
there are a great many cases. The chiropractor who is careful
in handling these incoördinations will find no class of cases
that will give more satisfactory results. The analyzing must
be done very carefully and the vertebrae must be moved from
the very beginning because if results are not obtained quickly
the inflammation will spread to the air vesicles very rapidly.
When this occurs there is danger of serious complications.</p>


<h3>Symptoms</h3>

<p>In the more mild form of bronchitis the symptoms develop
rather gradually and the first noticed may be a coryza or nasal
catarrh. As the bronchi become involved there will be a slight
rise in the temperature, noticeably increased respiration, and
a slight cough. There may be restlessness, anorexia and
vomiting, usually caused by swallowing the mucous that is
coughed up.</p>

<p>Rales are heard over the entire chest. These appear very
early and may remain for some little time after all other
symptoms have disappeared. It is very common to hear coarse
rales with a very slight cold in the young infant.</p>

<p>If the condition is permitted to go for some little time
without adjustments the symptoms become more severe. The
cough becomes more serious, there is dyspnea, increased fever
and a moderate degree of prostration which increases as time
goes on. During inspiration the nostrils will be noticeably
dilated. In most cases there is great difficulty in nursing. In
the later stages there is usually great prostration. The cry
becomes feeble and the cough weak, there is rapid superficial
respiration and feeble pulse. The facial expression is dull and
there may be stupor and apathy. The attacks may come on
very suddenly and terminate fatally in a very short time.
Therefore it is necessary for action from the adjustments to
be obtained as quickly as possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</span></p>


<h3>Equation and Family</h3>

<p>The subluxation at lower cervical or upper dorsal region
interferes with the transmission of mental impulses to the
bronchi. The function primarily involved is motor which
results in a relaxation of the muscular walls of the capillaries.
This produces hyperemia and congestion from which there is
an exudate of mucous. At first it is clear, but with normal
heat applied to this exudate it soon becomes mucopurulent.
This gives calorific plus, therefore the equation for the mucous
membrane lining the bronchi is calorific plus (C+) with N.C.R.
for the mucopurulent discharge. The equation for the general
fever is C+. The family is fever and degenerations.</p>

<p>The major adjustment for acute catarrhal bronchitis is L.C.
or Up.D. with K.P. In some cases CP. will be included in
the combination.</p>


<h3 class="center no-indent">CHRONIC BRONCHITIS</h3>

<p>It can readily be seen that chronic bronchitis would not
often be found with the very young infant. In early childhood
it is more often found and frequently follows the acute attack
or is the sequel of measles, influenza or whooping-cough. Unhygienic
surroundings may tend to influence and exaggerate
the condition.</p>


<h3>Symptoms</h3>

<p>There is little or no fever, although the cough is bad; there
is very little if any dyspnea. The condition becomes worse
during cold weather, and the patient is usually subject to
attacks of acute bronchitis. There may be no constitutional
symptoms and the general health of the patient may not be
greatly affected.</p>

<p>If there is a light rise in the bodily temperature regularly
in the evening, with loss of weight and slight anemia, pulmonary
tuberculosis should be suspected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</span></p>


<h3>Major Adjustment</h3>

<p>The adjustment for chronic bronchitis is the same as that
for acute bronchitis, Up.D. and K.P. If the child receives
adjustments during the acute attack the chronic condition will
not develop.</p>

<p>A child suffering with chronic bronchitis should be given
adjustments immediately and the results will be most
satisfactory, complete recovery resulting in a very short
time.</p>


<h3 class="center no-indent">BRONCHIAL CROUP (Fibrinous Bronchitis)</h3>

<p>This incoördination is relatively rare in small children,
except in diphtheria, when it appears as a contamination into
the bronchi from the larynx and trachea. It may be acute or
chronic and affects all ages from infancy to puberty. The
characteristics are severe dyspnea and the coughing up of
fibrinous casts from the large bronchi after which there is a
marked improvement. As the exudate collects again the symptoms
reappear. In the chronic form there is dyspnea and
expectoration of fibrinous casts.</p>


<h3>Major Adjustment</h3>

<p>The adjustment for fibrinous bronchitis is the same as that
for other forms of bronchitis. The prognosis is excellent, providing
adjustments are given in time to enable Innate to overcome
the momentum. Results are obtained in a very short
time.</p>


<h3 class="center no-indent">PNEUMONIA</h3>

<p>Aside from digestive disturbances, the most common
incoördinations affecting infants are those involving the lungs,
and especially as a sequel following the so-called infectious
dis-eases. The different types of pneumonia are named according
to the area of the lungs involved and the nature of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</span>
changes affecting them. The two general divisions are
bronchopneumonia and lobar pneumonia. These two principal
groups are divided into several subdivisions according
to the particular pathology and stage of development. It is
not of vital importance to the chiropractor to know just what
part of the lungs or bronchi is involved or the nature of the
pathology. He must, however, be sufficiently familiar with
symptoms to correctly determine the zone in which the incoördination
is located. In bronchopneumonia the entire
bronchial wall of the small bronchi is affected, while in lobar
pneumonia the bronchitis is usually very superficial and the
terminal bronchi and alveoli are filled with a fibrant exudate.
An entire lobe may be involved or the inflammation may
involve only part of a lobe. Very often the two varieties,
bronchopneumonia and lobar pneumonia will be present in
the same case, one variety affecting one part of the lung,
while the other variety will affect another part of the lung.
In children by far the larger percentage of cases of pneumonia
is of the bronchopneumonia type; however, as has been stated,
the type of pneumonia is of little importance, but the location
of the zone or zones is of vital importance.</p>

<p>Bronchopneumonia occurs most often during the winter
months, being more prevalent in late winter or early spring.
One or both lungs may be involved, but the most common
seat of the inflammation is the lower left lobe, or if in front
only, the right apex. The local subluxation producing this
condition will be found to be the second or third dorsal
vertebra, which is producing the pressure upon the nerves
and interfering with the transmission of mental impulses. As
a result there is a relaxation of the muscular fibers of the
blood vessels which results in a distention of these vessels
in the affected area. The seat of the catarrhal inflammation
is in the mucous membrane of the large and small
bronchi.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</span></p>


<h3>Symptoms</h3>

<p>The most frequent type of bronchopneumonia among infants
is the acute congestive type. Its duration may be only
one or two days. The symptoms develop very rapidly and
produce a great shock to the nervous system because of the
suddenness and severity of the attack. There is a sudden rise
of temperature and prostration is very great from the beginning.
There is cyanosis and rapid respiration. There may
be no cough. There may be little or no pain felt in the chest.
During respiration the expansion of the affected side will be
less than that of the unaffected side. However, this must not
be confused with the natural tendency found in extremely
young infants; when a child is placed in certain positions the
expansion of one lung will be greater than that of the other.
In the severe cases there is profound stupor and other cerebral
symptoms, such as dullness, apathy and there may be convulsions.
The progress of the incoördination is very rapid,
due to the sudden engorgement of the lungs, which in the
infant produces symptoms almost the same as those of consolidation
in older children or in adults. This is due to the
air vesicles being extremely small. These cases should be
adjusted as soon as there is a manifestation of symptoms,
otherwise the momentum of the dis-ease may, because of its
rapid progress, become so great that it will be impossible
for Innate to overcome. When the medium and small sized
bronchi only are affected, it is known as capillary bronchitis.
The symptoms will be very much the same as in the type
just mentioned, with the exception that in this type there is
always a more or less severe cough. Prostration is not so
great and the symptoms do not develop so rapidly. There is
very rapid respiration with dyspnea and rales over the entire
chest. There are symptoms which will indicate consolidation.
While bronchopneumonia may come on very abruptly, yet it
is not uncommon for the symptoms of bronchitis to merge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</span>
gradually into those of pneumonia. From a chiropractic standpoint
it would make little difference to the chiropractor
whether the condition was called bronchitis or bronchopneumonia,
for if adjustments are given at the beginning results
will be obtained before a diagnostician would be able to make
a positive diagnosis.</p>

<p>Children with pneumonia should not be permitted to lie
in one position for any length of time. A constant change in
the position is essential to prevent the accumulation of the
exudate in a localized area. The child may be more easily
cared for and made more comfortable by being held in the
arms of an adult. This will permit frequent changing of the
child’s position with very little disturbance to the child. In
all cases of pneumonia plenty of fresh air is essential, but if
there is any bronchitis, care must be exercised that the air is
not too cold. In cases involving hepatization there is no
danger of having the air too cold.</p>


<h3>Symptoms of Lobar Pneumonia</h3>

<p>Lobar pneumonia is not so frequent in infants as is
bronchopneumonia although it does occur occasionally in early
infancy. The previous health of the child seems to make little
difference, since it often occurs in the strong and robust children.
As a matter of fact, the strong child is more likely to
contract this form of pneumonia.</p>

<p>There are three stages in lobar pneumonia. There is: first,
the congestion; second, the red hepatization, in which the
lung becomes filled with a fibrant exudate containing red blood
corpuscles; the third stage, that of gray hepatization, wherein
the exudate undergoes a decomposition. These stages are of
little importance to the chiropractor, except to indicate the
degree of momentum attained by the incoördination. The
first symptoms usually consist in loss of appetite, general
weakness and headache. There is restlessness, excessive
thirst, dry skin and a high temperature. There is rapid pulse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</span>
and the respirations are from forty to fifty per minute. During
the night the child is restless and slightly delirious. Occasionally
there are convulsions, but this is very rare.</p>


<h3>Equation and Family</h3>

<p>The chiropractor is concerned chiefly in the location of the
incoördination and the family involved. In order to determine
the family it is first necessary to know the functions that are
abnormally involved. From the symptoms given we observe
readily that all cases of pneumonia, of whatever type, will
be in the fever family, but it is quite obvious that this is not
the only family involved. From the symptoms manifest we
recognize that there is hyperemia and exudate, that this exudate
undergoes degeneration and thus becomes of a toxic
nature. The fever, or C+ condition, is exaggerated by the
presence of this poison being retained in the body. This gives
us an overlapping of the poison and the fever families.</p>


<h3>Major Adjustment</h3>

<p>The major for the poison family is K.P.; for the fever
family C.P., the local being Lu.P.; therefore, the combination
major is lung place, center place, and kidney place. In making
an analysis of the infant with pneumonia it is of the utmost
importance to select the specific vertebra in these different
regions. Although the patient will have quite a temperature,
in many cases a hot box may be detected in the spine. In
endeavoring to find a hot box in the spine of an infant the back
of the patient should be exposed for sufficient length of time
to eliminate the possibility of the temperature being greater
at one point than at another because of clothing that may have
been heavier at one point than at another.</p>

<p>The vertebra causing the impingement at lung place may
be either second or third dorsal. This should be determined
by very careful palpation and by the presence of the hot box.
We cannot emphasize too greatly the necessity for very careful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</span>
palpation, since in the child nerve tracing can very seldom
be used. In severe cases it may be necessary to adjust as
often as once every six hours. With careful conscientious
work on the part of the chiropractor, there should be very
little danger in losing a patient, even in the most severe cases,
and if the adjustments are given in the early stages of the
dis-ease, the more marked symptoms will not develop, results
will be shown in a very few hours and the child will recover
in a short time.</p>


<h3 class="center no-indent">ASTHMA</h3>

<p>The type of asthma found among adults very seldom affects
infants. The most common form is associated with mild
attacks of bronchitis and is of a catarrhal nature. The attacks
are very likely to accompany or be associated with different
incoördinations involving the bronchi. In some cases the
attacks seem to be exaggerated by certain kinds of food which
the child eats. It is thought by some that attacks are brought
on by the indigestion of some foreign protein. These proteins
are very numerous and it is very difficult to determine the
particular food in which the offending protein is found. In
some patients an attack of asthma may be brought on by the
eating of eggs. From a chiropractic standpoint we do not consider
that the cause of asthma is in the food which the child
eats, although there might be an interference with transmission
which would impede the normal processes of digestion,
this would result in the production of a poison which might
produce certain symptoms. This, however, does not change
the fact that when the subluxations are properly adjusted the
incoördinations will disappear, regardless of the kind of food
that the patient eats.</p>


<h3>Symptoms</h3>

<p>The acute attack of asthma is accompanied with slight
fever and acute catarrhal symptoms. Later the typical asthmatic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</span>
symptoms appear in which there is a constriction of
the bronchi due to spasms of the unstriped muscular fibers.
There is hyperemia in the mucous membrane and a slight
exudate. Usually the tonsils are enlarged and there are
adenoid growths. There is more or less severe dyspnea,
moderate cyanosis and, in severe cases, prostration. The
peculiarity in respiration consists in a short inhalation with
slow, labored exhalation. Dyspnea may be so severe that
it is impossible for the child to breathe lying down. There
is an almost constant dry teasing cough. Many infants suffering
from asthma are inclined to be rachitic.</p>


<h3>Equation</h3>

<p>The functions involved are motor and calorific; C+ for
the heat in the mucous membrane lining the bronchi and M+
for the contraction, muscular contraction in the bronchi, with
T+ for the accumulation of the mucin.</p>


<h3>Family</h3>

<p>This condition involves two families, the fever and spasms
family.</p>


<h3>Major Adjustment</h3>

<p>Asthma is caused by a subluxation in the lower cervical
or the upper dorsal region, producing pressure upon the nerves
which transmit mental impulses to the pharynx and bronchi,
interfering primarily with the motor function. The major
adjustment is lower cervical or upper dorsal in combination
with kidney place.</p>

<p class="center no-indent fs120 bold">DIGESTIVE TRACT</p>


<h3 class="center no-indent">GASTRITIS</h3>

<p>Incoördinations of the stomach alone are less frequent in
infancy than are those of the intestines. Usually the stomach
and intestines are involved at the same time and it becomes
impossible to differentiate the two. The greater part of
digestion during infancy takes place in the intestinal tract,
the stomach acting more as a receptacle for the milk from
which food passes slowly into the intestinal tract to be properly
digested. In an infant one month old the stomach will
be empty one and one-half hours after nursing; in bottle-fed
babies it will take a little longer. From two to eight months
of age the time is about two hours for breast-fed babies and
from two and a half to three hours for those taking cow’s
milk.</p>


<h3>Symptoms</h3>

<p>The symptoms of gastritis come on very suddenly with
pain and tenderness in the epigastric region, and with a high
temperature which after the onset decreases. There is thirst,
loss of appetite, and vomiting. The vomited matter is usually
sour and may be streaked with blood. If there is an excessive
amount of blood it indicates ulcers. This is rather unusual,
however, in small children. Vomiting is excited by anything
taken into the stomach. The thirst is intense, although the
water will be vomited as soon as taken. The tongue is heavily
coated and the breath is foul. If these symptoms continue
intestinal symptoms will soon develop.</p>

<p>The different kinds of gastritis are given as: catarrhal,
ulcerative, membranous and corrosive; but the symptoms are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</span>
all very much the same and from a chiropractic standpoint a
knowledge of the particular pathology would be of no value
as the adjustment would be the same. In these cases the
difference, or rather specific diagnosis, cannot be made,
medically, until after the autopsy. In the ulcerative type the
condition is more prolonged and there is a greater tendency
to hemorrhage which results in a greater amount of blood
in the material vomited. Corrosive gastritis is the result of
a corrosive poison being taken into the stomach, such as
carbolic acid.</p>


<h3>Major Adjustment</h3>

<p>From a chiropractic standpoint it is immaterial what form
of gastritis the child may be suffering from with the exception
of the corrosive type which may require the administration of
an antidote. In this event the condition passes out of the
realm of Chiropractic the same as any other traumatic condition.
The adjustment in all cases of gastritis the same as
in any other incoördination of the stomach is S.P. If there
are symptoms which indicate that the poison family is involved
the combination would include K.P.</p>

<p>If adjustments are given at the onset results will be
obtained almost instantly. The temperature will soon be
reduced, the pain will be relieved and in a remarkably short
time the symptoms will all disappear.</p>


<h3 class="center no-indent">CHRONIC GASTRITIS</h3>

<p>There are no characteristic peculiarities associated with
gastritis when it becomes chronic. There is no advantage in
differentiating the chronic from the acute. The symptoms are
somewhat less severe, and run a longer course. There is
vomiting following meals. Between meals there will be a
regurgitation of the food. This form of indigestion is not
common among infants but may be found with older children.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</span>
The most prominent symptom is that of malnutrition. There
is restlessness at night, loss of appetite, constant loss of weight
and anemia.</p>


<h3>Major Adjustment</h3>

<p>The adjustment in the case of chronic gastritis is the same
as in the acute attacks. Stomach place is the condition of
the stomach with kidney place for the elimination of the waste
products which result from the lack of digestion. The kidney
place adjustment is also to correct any abnormality in the
serous circulation resulting from faulty digestion.</p>


<h3 class="center no-indent">STOMATITIS</h3>

<p>Dr. James N. Firth, in his “Chiropractic Symptomatology,”
states that “There are five forms of stomatitis, viz.: simple,
ulcerative, follicular, thrush and gangrenous.” It is not our
thought to cover this subject in detail as he has done, but only
to point out that which is characteristic of stomatitis in infants
and small children. In this incoördination the mucous membrane
lining the mouth becomes inflamed and swollen. The
mouth is hot and the lips dry. The child is fretful and even
though hungry refuses to nurse or will cry while trying to
nurse. There is quite an increase in the secretion of saliva.</p>

<p>Stomatitis in infants often accompanies the acute febrile
dis-eases or may appear alone. There will be more or less
indigestion with possibly some diarrhea. If the condition
remains for a great length of time the child becomes emaciated
from the lack of food ingestion.</p>

<p>It is not necessary for us to take up the different forms
of stomatitis since the adjustment is the same in all cases.
Upon the first indication of stomatitis or the slightest symptom
of sore mouth, the infant should receive prompt attention.
Strict hygienic measures should be used, especially if the child
is being bottle fed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</span></p>


<h3>Equation</h3>

<p>In stomatitis the equation is C+ for the simple form; for
the suppurative form it is N.C.R.</p>


<h3>Family</h3>

<p>Simple stomatitis is classified in the fever family. The
other forms involve the poison and degeneration families.</p>


<h3>Major Adjustment</h3>

<p>The adjustment for simple stomatitis is S.P. in combination
with M.C.P. If there is any suppuration involving the
poison and degenerations family the major will include K.P.</p>


<h3 class="center no-indent">GLOSSITIS</h3>

<p>Glossitis is not very common among infants. It is an
inflammatory condition of the tongue with hyperemia and
swelling. There is usually a slight temperature and the swelling
may involve the mucous membrane of the mouth. The
tongue may be so greatly swollen that it becomes very difficult
for the child to take food. Glossitis is often associated with
stomatitis or any involvement of the mucous membrane of
the mouth.</p>


<h3>Equation</h3>

<p>The equation for glossitis is C+ with T+ for the
hyperemia. If there is suppuration it is N.C.R.</p>


<h3>Family</h3>

<p>This condition is in the fever family overlapping the
degenerations family in case of suppuration.</p>


<h3>Major Adjustment</h3>

<p>The major adjustment for glossitis is S.P. and in cases
involving suppuration K.P.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</span></p>


<h3 class="center no-indent">STENOSIS OF THE PYLORUS</h3>

<p>There are two types of stenosis of the pylorus in infancy.
One is a stenosis due to a muscular spasm of the pylorus
called a pylorospasm. The other is a stenosis due to a hypertrophy
of the pylorus known as hypertrophic stenosis of the
pylorus. It is possible for both conditions to be present at
the same time. The stenosis may be congenital and is usually
called stenosis of infancy. It is considered a serious condition
and the mortality is very high.</p>

<p>This incoördination is characterized by constipation, persistent
wasting, projectile vomiting, and a marked visible
tumor.</p>


<h3>Symptoms</h3>

<p>The symptoms begin to appear during the first or second
week of life. Up to this time the child may have been gaining
and showing all signs of perfect health. Vomiting is usually
the first symptom to appear and this may be at irregular times
but without apparent cause. It soon becomes very forcible
and later projectile. The symptoms of indigestion are absent;
there is no eructations of gas; the breath is sweet and the
appetite is good. There is no evidence of pain and there is
no fever, yet the child steadily wastes and loses in weight.</p>

<p>The contests of the stomach are sometimes expelled with
such force that the food will be thrown a distance of two or
three feet. The food sometimes comes through the nose. The
vomiting takes place immediately after feeding and sometimes
while the child is nursing. The fact that the child will nurse
after vomiting and sometimes will leave the breast only while
the food contents of the stomach are being ejected shows that
the vomiting is not the result of indigestion; the fact that the
food is all expelled at one time and not regurgitated at intervals
is further proof. The food seldom remains in the
stomach long enough for gastric digestion to take place, therefore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</span>
the vomited food is not digested but it is just about in
the same stage as it was when taken into the stomach. In
some cases, however, the vomiting may not take place immediately;
in some cases the food may even be retained for
two or three feedings, although this is unusual.</p>

<p>The constipation is very obstinate from the fact that the
food is vomited and does not pass into the intestinal tract.
In the severe cases the stools resemble meconium. There is
very little fecal matter in the stool. In the severe cases there
is persistent loss of weight which may amount to two or three
ounces per day. The constipation is very marked and the
urine is scanty.</p>

<p>In the mild cases the symptoms are all less marked. The
vomiting may be only occasional, the loss of weight is not so
great, fecal matter is passed in the stools and there may even
be a gain in weight at times.</p>

<p>Due to the character of the vomiting which is projectile
the symptoms are sometimes mistaken for cerebral symptoms.
The scanty urine and the vomiting confuse the condition with
renal dis-ease. It is not difficult to distinguish stenosis of the
pylorus from gastric indigestion. The latter rarely develops
suddenly, but is very common in infants. The vomiting
usually occurs shortly after feeding.</p>


<h3>Equation</h3>

<p>If the condition is the result of hypertrophy of the pylorus
the equation is X+. If it is a case of pylorospasm the equation
would be M+. The equation for the loss of weight and
wasting is N-.</p>


<h3>Family</h3>

<p>The family of the hypertrophic condition of the pylorus
would be tumor family while the pylorospasm would come in
the spasms family.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</span></p>


<h3>Major Adjustment</h3>

<p>The adjustment for this condition would be stomach place
in combination with kidney place. The adjustment results
in a relaxation of the muscular fibers of the pylorus and permits
the food to pass from the stomach. In case of hypertrophic
stenosis of the pylorus there is not only a relaxation
of the muscular fibers, but Innate Intelligence removes the
hypertrophy and thus enables the food to pass from the
stomach. Excellent results are obtained in these cases. Care
should be exercised in making the analysis and the adjustments
should be given as early in the progress of the condition
as possible.</p>


<h3 class="center no-indent">ACUTE INTESTINAL INDIGESTION</h3>

<p>This is quite a common incoördination and is very much
more prevalent in hot weather. It is found often in very
young infants, but more often in children during their second
summer. There are many forms and degrees of acute intestinal
indigestion among infants and small children. The
attacks come on usually very abruptly and may be severe
from the beginning. The most outstanding feature of the
incoördination is the characteristic diarrhea. In the mild
form the symptoms develop suddenly with marked gastric
disturbances. At the beginning there is colicky pain and
tympanites. There is great restlessness and typical symptoms
of colic. The diarrhea appears in a very short time. The
color of the stool is at first yellow, then it becomes a yellowish
green and finally a grass green. It will usually contain undigested
foods. The odor is very foul, grass green, and very
much thinner than normal. This mild form may develop into
the more severe type or the more severe form may develop
suddenly from the very beginning. The temperature rises
rapidly. The skin is hot and dry. At the beginning the child
is very restless and cries a great deal, but later he lies in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</span>
a stupor, the eyes are sunken, pulse is weak and there is all
the appearance of an attack of serious illness. There may
be anorexia. There is usually great thirst and nausea and
vomiting. In a few hours there is marked diarrhea. The
stools are yellow and of a thin consistency with a very offensive
odor. There is usually much gas expelled. There may
be as many as four or five stools an hour. This incoördination
is responsible for a great many deaths among children. They
respond, however, very quickly to chiropractic adjustments.</p>


<h3>Major Adjustment</h3>

<p>The subluxation responsible for intestinal indigestion will
be found in the lumbar region, usually upper lumbar. It may
be necessary to include kidney place for the elimination of the
products of the indigestion. This condition is in the fever
family overlapping the poison family.</p>


<h3 class="center no-indent">CHOLERA INFANTUM</h3>

<p>When the severe type of intestinal indigestion is accompanied
with gastric disturbances and severe vomiting, it is
known as cholera infantum. In this form the temperature
rises rapidly and the symptoms develop quickly and become
very severe in a remarkably short time. The vomiting is very
severe and usually appears simultaneously with the diarrhea.
After the stomach has been emptied of food the vomitus becomes
serum and mucous. The contents of the small intestines
may regurgitate into the stomach and be vomited up.
Vomiting may be induced by taking water into the stomach.
The stools are frequent, are of a pale green, yellow or brownish
color at the beginning, but later become almost entirely serous.
In the severe cases the bowels may be evacuated every few
minutes. This type differs from that previously described in
that the stools are practically odorless. In rare cases, however,
they may be exceedingly offensive. There is probably
no other incoördination during childhood in which there is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</span>
such a rapid loss of weight. The picture which the patient
presents is characteristic. There is great weakness and prostration
from the very beginning. The fontanel is depressed
and in some cases there may even be an overlapping of the
cranial bones. The features become sharp, the eyes are deeply
sunken and the angle of the mouth is drawn down. The nose
is pinched, the skin over the forehead is tense and dry, the
temples are sunken. There is pallor, stupor, marked relaxation
of the lips and there will be convulsions and collapse.
Statistics show that under medical treatment fully three-fourths
of the cases die.</p>


<h3>Major Adjustment</h3>

<p>Most excellent results are obtained in these cases under
chiropractic adjustments. In the severe attacks it will be
found necessary to adjust the child as often as once every
six hours. The subluxations will be found at stomach place
and kidney place and middle lumbar. Some very severe cases
have come under our personal observation and in the cases
that we have handled personally the results have been 100%.
Such cases must be analyzed very carefully, and must have
the very best care in every way.</p>


<h3 class="center no-indent">CHRONIC INTESTINAL INDIGESTION</h3>

<p>Chronic intestinal indigestion is a very common incoördination
affecting children. It is more likely to be found among
children who are artificially fed. Intestinal indigestion is responsible
for a great variety of symptoms that are sometimes
considered separate dis-eases.</p>


<h3>Symptoms</h3>

<p>Children suffering with intestinal indigestion usually present
symptoms of malnutrition. They are anemic, the extremities
being usually very small. The most striking feature
of such a case will be the extremely large abdomen. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</span>
colon is usually dilated as are also the small intestines. There
is marked tympanites, which usually increases during the daytime
but diminishes during the night. This is one of the principal
symptoms which differentiate intestinal indigestion from
tubercular peritonitis. Such children are easily fatigued, have
a very sallow complexion with dark rings under the eyes.
They are usually very much below the average weight and are
very cross and irritable. They do not sleep well, often grinding
their teeth and crying out in their sleep. There is usually
alternating constipation and diarrhea, the odor of the stools
being very offensive. In extreme cases there may be convulsions
and other cerebral symptoms. There is seldom any
fever.</p>


<h3>Major Adjustment</h3>

<p>The local major subluxation will be found in the lumbar
region with the combination at kidney place. Kidney place
is used only when there has been an accumulation of products
of indigestion which makes it necessary to increase elimination
to take care of these products. In many of these cases
the liver is involved and therefore will call for liver place in
combination with kidney place and the local lumbar. These
cases will respond very readily to chiropractic adjustments.</p>


<h3 class="center no-indent">COLIC</h3>

<p>Colic is a common incoördination of infancy and is very
prevalent during the first three months. Colic is a symptom
rather than a dis-ease and usually indicates intestinal indigestion
or some inflammatory condition of the intestines. It is
characterized by sharp paroxysmal pains in the intestines.
A child who is subject to colic will usually be suffering also
from constipation. The crying of a colicky child is characteristic,
being very violent and paroxysmal, which presently
subsides only to be followed with another attack. During
these spells the lower extremities will be drawn up and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</span>
abdomen will be tense from the accumulation of gas. In mild
cases the child will not cry out but will be fretful. This may
be wrongly construed to be the result of hunger. When the
attacks of colic come on the child will show a desire to nurse
and will take the breast as though very hungry. This may
be followed by relief from the pain, but this relief is only
temporary and when the pain returns it is usually more severe.
There is probably no incoördination of childhood that is quite
so trying to a chiropractor as an acute attack of colic, due
to the violent crying of the child and the eager desire on the
part of the chiropractor and the attendants to relieve the pain.
It is often quite hard to obtain a correct analysis in such cases
because of the difficulty experienced in getting the child into
a proper position for palpation. In making the palpation the
chiropractor should take plenty of time and should never
endeavor to force the child to be still, rather he should adapt
himself to the constant moving about of the infant.</p>


<h3>Major Adjustment</h3>

<p>The major varies somewhat in these cases so far as a
specific vertebra is concerned, but the local will always be
found in the lumbar region, usually the first or second lumbar
vertebra. Kidney place should be used as a combination.</p>


<h3>VOMITING</h3>

<p>During nursing the infant swallows quite a little air and
not infrequently this is the cause of vomiting immediately
following feeding. It is not uncommon for an infant to vomit
without effort after overfilling the stomach. This is a natural
thing among healthy children and needs no attention from a
corrective standpoint. In such cases the milk is but little
changed.</p>

<p>In gastric indigestion and gastritis vomiting is always
present, but in these cases it does not take place until some
time after feeding, perhaps several hours. In gastritis the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</span>
vomiting is more constant. In the more severe cases there
will be not only the partially digested food but also bile and
mucus and sometimes traces of blood.</p>

<p>Obstructive vomiting is sometimes found among infants
and may be due to intestinal obstruction or to an obstruction
of the pyloris. The obstruction may be congenital or it may
develop after birth. Obstruction of the pyloris may be the
result of hypertrophic stenosis. In this condition the child
vomits immediately following feeding and with great force.
This is thoroughly described in the article on Hypertrophic
Stenosis of the Pylorus. If the obstruction is in the intestinal
tract it may be the result of a congenital malformation or due
to intussusception. The vomiting is forceful and the vomitus
may contain fecal matter.</p>

<p>Vomiting is often associated with peritonitis and appendicitis.
In these conditions there is distention of the abdomen
with abdominal pains which may be localized. There may
also be a slight temperature. Vomiting is purely adaptative
on the part of Innate Intelligence. The food cannot be
digested and carried through the digestive tract so Innate
realizes that the best thing to do is to free the body from
it in the quickest manner.</p>

<p>Vomiting often precedes such incoördinations as pneumonia,
scarlet fever and malaria and may precede any of the
febrile dis-eases. Vomiting may be produced by the accumulation
and absorption of toxines in the body.</p>

<p>Infants suffering with nervous disorders such as acute
meningitis, tumors of the brain and other central conditions
will often have cerebral vomiting. In this event the vomiting
is spontaneous and does not necessarily occur at feeding time.
Other cerebral symptoms present will aid in determining the
analysis.</p>

<p>Vomiting may be produced by the presence of worms that
come up into the throat from the stomach and intestinal tract.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</span>
Hunger may occasionally bring on an attack of vomiting.
This is more common in older children than in infants.</p>


<h3 class="center no-indent">RECURRENT VOMITING</h3>

<p>This is also known as cyclic vomiting and periodical vomiting.
It is characterized by recurrent attacks which may be
weeks or months apart. They come on without any apparent
cause and from the descriptions and explanations given in
medical science very little can be done medically to control
the vomiting which at the end of two or three days will cease
spontaneously. The attacks recur at different intervals, usually
less often, gradually decreasing until they cease altogether
when the patient is about the age of ten or twelve years.</p>


<h3>Symptoms</h3>

<p>There is loss of appetite and malaise. The pulse becomes
rapid and in some cases there is slight temperature. There
is usually headache and excessive thirst. During the attack
of vomiting there is extreme retching and great distress. The
symptoms are similar to migraine in adults. This condition
must be differentiated from tubercular meningitis in which
there is vomiting without apparent cause. The course of the
symptoms will soon enable a positive differentiation. In
acute indigestion there is vomiting, but the history of the
case reveals the fact that the attack was brought on by
undigested food. It is very easy to distinguish this type of
vomiting from that of appendicitis, since in appendicitis there
is marked tenderness at McBurney’s point, also pain and the
characteristic rigidity and muscular contraction. In intussusception
the symptoms are usually more severe and there
is blood and mucus in the stool.</p>


<h3>Major Adjustment</h3>

<p>Since there seems to be no particular indication of indigestion
or impaired functions, and no pathological changes, it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</span>
evident that the function involved is that of motor. But regardless
of the primary function that is interfered with a
subluxation will be found at S. P. and in most cases there
will be a hot box during the acute attack. The vertebra
most commonly subluxated is the sixth dorsal. In most cases
there is no combination and results will be obtained in a very
short time by adjusting nothing but the S.P. subluxation.
In the severe cases it may be necessary to adjust as often as
once every six hours until the vomiting ceases. Ordinarily
the vomiting will cease in a short time and in most cases
marked improvement will be noted after the first adjustment.</p>

<p>Vomiting occurs in gastric indigestion, intussusception,
meningitis, peritonitis, pyloric stenosis, uremic poisoning, and
in many other acute incoördinations.</p>


<h3 class="center no-indent">CONSTIPATION</h3>

<p>The first bowel movement after birth is known as
meconium and is a dark brownish-green color, and of a semi-solid
consistency. During the first two or three days the
bowels move from four to six times daily. On the third day
the character of the stools begin to change and by the fourth
day the feces has become normal.</p>

<p>The normal stool of a normal nursing infant is about the
color of the yolk of an egg, and may be slightly green. The
average amount is about two ounces daily. The stools should
never be watery, but of a butter-like consistency. During the
first few weeks the infant’s bowels will move on an average
of four times daily. After about six weeks the average will
be two a day. The stool changes in character as soon as the
child is placed upon a mixed diet. It then becomes more like
that of an adult but remains softer.</p>

<p>Constipation is one of the most common incoördinations
of infancy and childhood. There are many factors to be considered
and many things that contribute to the condition. In
older children habit plays no small part in aggravating constipation.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</span>
For this reason the child should be very carefully
trained early in life to obey the first call on Nature in this
respect.</p>

<p>Normally the infant should have two bowel movements a
day, although some have more while others may have only one.
Frequent movements do not, however, mean that the child is
not constipated or costive. With two or three dry hard stools
per day the child would be costive. Constipation is the result
of a lack of motor function in the muscular walls of the intestines
while costiveness is the result of a lack of secretion
due to interference with transmission of secretory mental
impulses. The two conditions are often associated. When
there is a lack of motor function in the muscular walls the
fecal matter will not be forced out of the intestinal tract fast
enough and much of the moisture will be absorbed, thus leaving
the fecal matter dry and hard. This is not a true costiveness
and should not be mistaken for such.</p>

<p>In costiveness there may be colicky pains which may be
increased, and may at times be quite severe, when the hard
dry fecal matter is passed. The general health of the child
may be seemingly normal. In severe cases hemorrhoids and
even hernia may be developed from the constant straining.</p>


<h3>Major Adjustment</h3>

<p>These cases are simple and respond readily to chiropractic
adjustments. The combination varies somewhat in different
cases. In constipation the major will be a lumbar vertebra.
In costiveness, where secretions are involved, the combination
will include a Li.P. and K. P. In some cases excellent results
are obtained by adjusting ninth dorsal.</p>


<h3 class="center no-indent">INTUSSUSCEPTION</h3>

<p>Intussusception is a condition wherein there is a telescoping
of the intestines in which one portion passes into the adjacent
portion and produces an obstruction.</p>

<p>This condition occurs most often in early infancy, although<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</span>
not very commonly. The most frequent site is at the ileocecal
valve. It may, however, occur at any point in the intestinal
tract. When it occurs in the small intestine it is known as
enteric intussusception; in the colon as colic; and at the
ileocecal valve as ilecocecal.</p>

<p>Intussusception may be chronic or acute. In the chronic
cases there may be adhesions which will make it very difficult
for Innate to accomplish a reduction.</p>


<h3>Symptoms</h3>

<p>The onset is usually accompanied with paroxysmals of
pains and vomiting. The pains may be very severe and the
vomiting projectile. The pain may be mistaken for that of
ordinary colic, but it is much more severe and may continue
through the entire attack.</p>

<p>The vomiting is persistent, especially at the onset, and
occurs as soon as food enters the stomach. In older children
it may be stercoraceous after the third or fourth day. It never
occurs, however, in infancy. The vomiting is the result of
the intestinal obstruction and is adaptative on the part of
Innate Intelligence. It is quite obvious that it is better not
to have food in the stomach than it is to have it and not be
able to complete the process of intestinal digestion.</p>

<p>The character of the stools is of importance. At first the
bowel movements may be diarrheal and later there will be
no fecal matter, but the stool will contain nothing but blood
and mucus. A paroxysm of colicky pain may be followed
by a mucous and bloody stool several times daily. At the onset
the abdominal walls are soft and relaxed, or may even be
retracted. Tympanites may occur about the second or third
day.</p>

<p>The symptoms in the acute cases are those of shock. There
is an extremely anxious look on the face which is pallid, cold
extremities, subnormal temperature and cold perspiration.
There is restlessness and in many cases convulsions. Later<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</span>
there will be stupor. A sudden rise in temperature indicates
a turn for the worse and may mean death in a short time.
In the chronic cases there is marked inanition which progresses
very rapidly.</p>


<h3>Major Adjustment</h3>

<p>The subluxation interfering with the transmission of
mental impulses causing intussusception will be found in the
lumbar region, the specific vertebra depending upon the location
of the intussusception, whether in the upper or lower
intestinal tract. Most excellent results have been obtained in
these cases, and there should be no hesitancy in adjusting.
The function involved is motor, which prevents a coördinate
action of the muscular walls of the intestines. As soon as this
action becomes normal Innate Intelligence will correct the
condition and all symptoms will subside.</p>


<h3 class="center no-indent">ICTERUS</h3>

<p>Icterus is a rather common incoördination of infancy. It
is characterized by yellowish discoloration of the skin produced
by the accumulation of bile pigment. This is the result
of an occlusion usually of the common bile duct, which prevents
the bile from passing into the duodenum. There are
two forms: the physiological and the pathological. In the
physiological there is an inflammation in the mucous membrane
lining the common bile duct. This causes a decrease
in the size of the lumen, which obstructs the flow of bile.
In the pathological there may be a complete obstruction due
to malformation or there may be a congenital absence of the
bile duct. While the common bile duct is the most common
seat of the pathological type, yet the hepatic and cystic ducts
may also be involved.</p>


<h3>Symptoms</h3>

<p>The most prominent symptoms is the discoloration of the
skin. In the severe obstructive jaundice the stools are white,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</span>
the urine dark brown and bile-stained and the liver and spleen
often enlarged. There may be severe convulsions. In the
more common and less exaggerated cases the foregoing symptoms
are present but in a milder form. There is typical jaundiced
discoloration which in some cases will appear soon after
birth. This will continue for a few days and may become
quite marked. The stools will be colorless, while the urine
will be highly colored.</p>


<h3>Equation and Family</h3>

<p>The equation is secretion plus (T+) and excretion minus
(E-) for the accumulation of the bile. The family is the
poison family. In case of temperature it overlaps the fever
family.</p>


<h3>Major Adjustment</h3>

<p>The chiropractor must not conclude that the case is one of
congenital malformation or absence of the bile duct merely
because of the extreme discoloration of the infant. Cases have
come under our observation in which the symptoms would
all indicate that the case was hopeless, but under chiropractic
adjustments they have recovered. It must be recognized, of
course, that if there is a congenital absence of the bile duct
the case is hopeless, but since there is no way of determining
whether it is a mere obstruction or congenital absence, the
case should by no means be considered hopeless. Every effort
should be made to locate and adjust the subluxation. The
subluxation will be found at liver place which must be adjusted
in combination with kidney place. Kidney place is required
for the elimination of the accumulated bile. These cases will
respond very quickly and satisfactorily under chiropractic
adjustments.</p>

<h3 class="center no-indent">MALNUTRITION</h3>

<p>This condition may result from a lack of the proper amount
of food and from unhygienic conditions. However, it is often
found among the children who should be properly nourished,
who have the very best of care and the most wholesome food.
There is no definite standard by which to determine a case
of malnutrition. The extreme cases are obvious, but a child
may be simply underweight and still not be classed as a case
of malnutrition. Up to eleven or twelve years of age a child
is not usually considered properly nourished if he is 10%
below the normal standard of weight for his age and height.
If the food supply is insufficient in quantity or quality, if there
are bad habits of eating, such as bolting the food, insufficient
mastication, and irregular hours of eating, these should all
receive proper attention. If, on the other hand, the supply
of food is sufficient in quantity and quality, if all habits of
eating are normal and there is malnutrition, it is because the
food is either not properly digested or not properly assimilated,
or both, and the child should receive prompt attention at the
hands of a competent chiropractor.</p>


<h3>Symptoms</h3>

<p>The symptoms of malnutrition are very obvious and need
no special mention here. Such children are usually irritable
and fretful. They are of a nervous disposition and very active.
They are usually very bright mentally and often excel in their
school work. Children suffering with malnutrition are very
susceptible to different incoördinations and may be sick a
great deal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</span></p>


<h3>Major Adjustment</h3>

<p>In these cases, if the child is provided with food having
sufficient nourishment, most excellent results will be obtained
from chiropractic adjustments. A very careful analysis must
be made in order to determine all the facts in the case for
the major differs in different individuals. In some cases the
major will be C.P. and K.P., in others S.P., K.P. and a lumbar,
while in some cases Li.P. and Sp.P. may be involved.</p>


<h3 class="center no-indent">INANITION</h3>

<p>This is the term applied to the condition resulting from
the lack of food assimilation, It affects principally young
infants. It is characterized by a persistent loss of weight
with more or less severe symptoms which may appear rather
suddenly.</p>


<h3>Symptoms</h3>

<p>The infant’s pulse is weak and rapid and the temperature
may be high. There is scanty urine, cold extremities and
great muscular relaxation. The face presents a peculiar bluish
gray color. There may be cyanosis. There is rapid irregular
respiration. In the more severe cases there may be stupor,
while in others the child is very restless and fretful. Pupils
are contracted and the fontanel is sunken. The progress of
the incoördination may be rapid and in very young infants
death may occur quite suddenly. Breast feeding is very essential
in these cases.</p>


<h3>Major Adjustment</h3>

<p>Inanition is really malnutrition in the young infant due
to a lack of assimilation of nutrition. The major adjustment
is C.P. or S.P. and K.P. In some cases Li.P. may be involved,
while in others Spl.P. may enter into the combination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</span></p>


<h3 class="center no-indent">MARASMUS</h3>

<p>This condition is also called infantile atrophy and simple
wasting. It is not very common and is usually found in institutions
for infants. It affects infants who are unusually
weak. It is said to result largely from improper food and
feeding and also it is influenced by the surroundings. In
these cases the methods of feeding and the character of food
should be carefully investigated. If these are found satisfactory
it will then be obvious that the food is not being
properly digested. This calls for a careful analysis and
adjusting of the child. In these cases the food can not be
assimilated because it is not properly digested. There is a
progressive and persistent loss in weight. The body temperature
becomes subnormal, the lung expansion imperfect,
emaciation very marked, the skin deeply wrinkled and the
face and arms take on a very old appearance. The eyes
appear very large, the temples and fontanels are sunken, and
the abdomen becomes very prominent. The child is very
susceptible to all forms of incoördinations and because of the
extreme weakness may succumb quickly to any acute dis-ease.
In some cases after the emaciation has become very marked
there may be an unusual and sudden gain in weight due to a
general edema. This condition may increase until all the
tissues of the body become extremely water-logged. The
large cavities, however, are very seldom affected. Infants
under seven or eight months of age are likely to be affected
by this edema.</p>


<h3>Major Adjustment</h3>

<p>These cases call for a combination major which consists
of S.P. and K.P. and an Up.L.P. Excellent results will be
attained in these cases if adjustments are given early enough
in the stage of the incoördination. The patient is never too
weak to be adjusted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</span></p>


<h3 class="center no-indent">SCURVY</h3>

<p>Scurvy is a condition resulting from faulty nutrition. It
is characterized by a swelling of the joints, sometimes pseudoparalysis
of the lower extremities and a spongy condition of
the gums which have a tendency to bleed. There may be
cachexia and anemia. This condition is supposed to result
from a continuous diet lacking in the vitamin C.</p>


<h3>Symptoms</h3>

<p>Usually the first symptoms to appear are tenderness of
the legs. This will be observed from the fact that the child
cries when his legs are moved. Eventually this tenderness
localizes about the knees and ankles and it is accompanied
with swelling of these parts. The gums then become swollen
and show a marked tendency to bleed. This swelling may
produce pain sufficient to interfere with the child taking food.
The child loses weight, becomes very fretful, and has a slight
fever. There is a characteristic posture in which the hips
are rotated outward, while there is a semi-flexion of the thighs
and legs. The child will usually lie very quietly because any
movement produces pain, especially in the legs. There is
marked sub-periosteal hemorrhages which may be so great
that the limbs will become twice their normal size. In severe
cases epiphyseal separation is not uncommon. Scurvy is very
often associated with rickets. However, it is affirmed that
they are two separate conditions and not just different forms
of the same condition.</p>


<h3>Major Adjustment</h3>

<p>This incoördination requires a combination major which
will be found at C.P. or S.P. and K.P.</p>


<h3 class="center no-indent">RICKETS</h3>

<p>Rickets is also called rachitis and known by some as Barlow’s
dis-ease. It is listed as a dis-ease of nutrition, although<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</span>
the most important anatomical changes which take place are
those affecting the bones. This dis-ease is found among people
of all classes. There is no race that is immune, yet some
nationalities seem to suffer more frequently and severely than
others. Negroes and Italians seem to be especially susceptible
when placed in northern climates and congested quarters in
northern cities. In general practice rickets is considered a
rather uncommon incoördination, although in congested cities
it will be found quite prevalent.</p>


<h3>Symptoms</h3>

<p>The first symptoms to appear are nocturnal restlessness
and profuse sweating about the head during sleep. The restlessness
is usually quite marked; the patient rolls and tosses
a great deal, and almost constantly moves the head back and
forth on the pillow. Because of the profuse sweating the
child becomes very susceptible to colds, bronchitis and bronchial
pneumonia. A case of rickets is rather easily recognized
by the large head, the pigeon breast, beaded ribs, the deformities
of the extremities, the swelling of the epiphyses of
the wrists and ankles, and the prominent abdomen.</p>


<h3>Deformities of the Head</h3>

<p>Deformity of the head appears very early in the dis-ease
and is due to the thickening of the cranial bones, producing
the typical square head of rickets. This square head is known
as caput quadratum. Numerous soft spots are formed in the
cranial bones which when pressed upon give one the impression
that he is feeling parchment. This is known as cranial
tabies. The fontanels and sutures are very late in closing,
sometimes as late as the third or fourth year. The large
rachitic head must not be mistaken for hydrocephalus.</p>


<h3>Deformities of the Thorax</h3>

<p>The chest is deformed in such a way that the transverse
diameter is decreased and the antero-posterior diameter is increased.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</span>
This produces the typical pigeon breast. Such deformity
is caused from the softening of the thoracic bones.
Beading of the ribs is characteristic and is known as the
rachitic rosary. These nodules are formed at the junction
line of the costal cartilages and the ribs. While these nodules
are always present, they are not always visible. The rachitic
gurgle, which is a transverse depression extending from one
side of the chest to the other and is about two inches broad,
is also present.</p>


<h3>Deformities of the Spine</h3>

<p>The most characteristic deformity of the spine in rickets
is a kyphosis usually involving the lower dorsal and the entire
lumbar region, although lateral curvatures may appear. In a
well defined case of rickets every bone in the body may be
abnormally involved. The deformity of the spine results
from a softening of the bones which give way under the
weight of the trunk.</p>


<h3>Deformities of the Extremities</h3>

<p>A case of rickets usually presents characteristic curvatures
of the bones. The long bones are, as a rule, involved symmetrically.
Green stick fractures very often occur. In practically
all cases of this dis-ease there is an arrested longitudinal
growth in the bones. Because of this the height will often
be very much less than that of the normal child. There is
marked enlargement of the epiphyses at the wrists and ankles.
The slight curvatures in the bones of the arms will be exaggerated
when the child begins to creep and the curvatures
in the legs will be increased when the child begins to stand
and walk.</p>


<h3>Deformities of the Abdomen</h3>

<p>Due to the general motor minus condition of the abdominal
muscles there is developed a condition known as pot belly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</span>
This enlargement is often exaggerated by intestinal indigestion
and constipation. This constipation results from the
motor minus condition which interferes with the vermicular
movement of the intestinal tract.</p>


<h3>Equation</h3>

<p>The function that is primarily involved in rickets is nutrition,
but this results in other functions being implicated. There
is expansion minus especially in the development of the osseous
tissue. The equation is N— with X—.</p>


<h3>Major Adjustment</h3>

<p>Most excellent results are obtained in rickets. It is very
essential that the adjustments be given at the beginning before
the deformities become marked. In the more chronic cases
the incoördination will be checked by the adjustments and the
patient will recover, but it will be obvious that the marked
deformities such as genu varum, genu valgrum, enlargement
of the wrist and deformities of the head can not be corrected
in the chronic cases. The adjustment is At. or Ax., S.P. and
K.P.</p>


<h3 class="center no-indent">NEUROTIC CHILDREN</h3>

<p>Neurotic symptoms may appear very early in infancy.
They may be first noticed when the child is startled by sudden
sounds or unusual sights. Ordinarily the infant, only a
few weeks of age, will pay little or no attention to its surroundings.
The neurotic infant, however, may be startled or
badly frightened by its environment. Such infants are found
to apparently fix their attention upon objects as early as the
third or fourth week. If its attention is thus centered upon
a person who should make a quick, unexpected move, the
child often becomes terrified. In other cases the symptoms
may manifest themselves in a muscular spasm, such as mild
opisthotonos, and other conditions suggesting cerebral incoördination.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</span>
In early infancy vomiting and diarrhea may
be brought on by excitement. The vomiting takes place without
nausea and may be excited either by food or water. This
must be carefully distinguished from the spitting up of milk
so characteristic in infancy. This is a perfectly normal process
and seems to be Innate’s method of adaptation when the child
has taken too much milk into the stomach. Vomiting in
neurotic infants may even become so severe that it results
in a loss of weight. The diarrhea occurs with no more
apparent cause than the vomiting. If the stools are not too
frequent the food will be well digested but the diarrhea may
become so severe that the food passes through the intestinal
tract undigested. This diarrhea may be very obstinate and
then it results in serious malnutrition. As the child grows
older the characteristic symptoms of infancy become less
marked but the child continues to be extremely nervous,
irritable and cross. This nervousness may be exaggerated
by the surroundings. Such children usually have poor appetite
and suffer from constipation. They are almost always poorly
nourished and anemic. The pulse is usually more or less
rapid and is generally affected by excitement. Such children
are quite restless during sleep.</p>

<p>Neurotic children are often precocious but lack in concentration
due to their restlessness. Headache is a very common
symptom. There is a marked tendency toward habit,
spasm and chorea.</p>


<h3>Family</h3>

<p>These conditions are classified in the spasms family.</p>


<h3>Equation</h3>

<p>The equation is not so well defined since the condition
of nervousness is adaptative. Therefore the equation for the
nervousness is I.A. If other symptoms appear the equation
would depend upon the function involved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</span></p>


<h3>Major Adjustment</h3>

<p>It is maintained by most authorities that this nervousness
is inherited, but it has been demonstrated clinically by
Chiropractic that results are readily obtained by chiropractic
adjustments. It is reasonable to assume that there are environmental
conditions which might produce nervousness even in
the small infant, but it is also recognized that if the child is
normal he soon becomes accustomed to the peculiarities of
the environment and pays little or no attention to them. Subluxations
in the cervical region, usually atlas or axis, are found
in these children. These subluxations may produce sufficient
cord pressure to cause such symptoms as usually manifest
themselves in malnutrition as so-called nervous indigestion
and other symptoms which would indicate constitutional disorders.
A very careful analysis reveals that the nervousness
in some of these cases is adaptative to some other incoördination.
If the nervousness is direct the major adjustment will
be Up.C. with a possible combination of C.P. and K.P. If
the nervousness is adaptative, then a very careful analysis
must be made to determine the incoördination to which it is
adaptative. The major then will be determined by the location
and the family involved.</p>


<h3 class="center no-indent">CONVULSIONS</h3>

<p>A convulsion is a violent involuntary contraction of muscles
which ordinarily contract only under direction of the will.
It may be either clonic or tonic. A clonic convulsion consists
of a spasm of the muscles with alternating contractions
and relaxations while the tonic spasm consists in constant
rigidity of the muscles involved. The contractions may be
confined to certain muscles or sets of muscles as, for example,
the muscles of the face, the trunk or the extremities. In
some cases the muscles of the entire body are involved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</span></p>

<p>During the first eighteen months of life the child is more
susceptible to convulsions than at a later age, although the
condition is rather common during childhood. Convulsions
accompany many incoördinations and are considered adaptative
to some other condition. Therefore the first thing to
consider in a case of this kind is the primary condition or the
incoördination to which the convulsion is adaptative.</p>

<p>The more common conditions with which convulsions are
associated are: Incoördinations involving the nervous system,
such as cerebra-spinal conditions; rachitis; and organic and
functional disorders. Any condition which produces an irritation
of the nervous system may result in a convulsion of
more or less violence. For this reason children are often
subject to convulsions during dentition and disorders resulting
in slight temperature. Cerebral tumors, abscesses of the brain,
hydrocephalus and meningitis are examples of cerebral conditions
in which convulsions are commonly found.</p>

<p>Subluxations in the upper cervical region are often produced
at the time of birth which cause cord pressure, making
the child susceptible to all conditions that would irritate the
nervous system.</p>

<p>There may be K.P. subluxations interfering with the
process of elimination resulting in an accumulation of poison
within the body, or there may be other subluxations resulting
in the production of toxines within the body and these will
produce an irritation of the nervous system resulting in convulsions.
Disturbances in digestion, affections of the respiratory
tract, a sudden rise of temperature and incoördinations
involving the gastro-intestinal tract are often responsible for
convulsions. Convulsions are quite frequent at the onset of
acute dis-eases such as whooping-cough, measles and mumps.
They are often associated with enlargement of the thymus
gland.</p>

<p>During the convulsion there may be loss of consciousness
with tonic and clonic spasms in various degrees of severity.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</span>
The urine may be voided and the bowels evacuated. In the
very young infant a single attack may prove fatal, although
this is rather unusual. When death occurs in this way it is
most often due to asphyxia, or when the convulsions recur in
rapid succession death will result from exhaustion.</p>

<p>The clinical picture is quite typical. Usually there is pallor
of the face which may be followed quickly with a twitching
of the facial muscles, and sometimes those of the hands and
feet. In most cases the attack comes on without warning;
the eyes become fixed and rolled backward; the twitching
usually begins in the face and very soon the entire body is
involved. The face is distorted by muscular contractions, the
head is drawn backward and the neck is thrown forward;
there may be frothing at the mouth. The pulse is irregular
and weak, the respiration is shallow and feeble while there is
cold perspiration of the forehead and it may also be on the
body. The thumbs are turned into the palms and the hands
are tightly closed. There is rhythmical convulsive movements
consisting of alternating flexion and extension.</p>

<p>The attack usually lasts from a few minutes to half an
hour and sometimes longer. The patient is left in a more or
less state of exhaustion and the attack may be followed by
stupor and coma. Very often convulsions in children over
two years of age indicate the onset of some acute condition
such as pneumonia or scarlet fever. However, convulsions
may mean very little with small children that are extremely
nervous. During the first few days of life they may be the
result of temporary circulatory disturbances in the brain from
prolonged pressure in difficult labor.</p>


<h3>Family</h3>

<p>All cases of convulsions are in the spasms family no matter
with what other conditions they are associated. If there are
other complications, and there usually are, the family for the
complications will depend upon the functions involved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</span></p>


<h3>Major Adjustment</h3>

<p>When a chiropractor is called to see a child that is having
convulsions he should make a very careful inquiry into the
history of the case and try to find the associated incoördination.
This is done for the purpose of determining the combination
to be used. The major for location will be atlas or
axis, while the combination will depend upon the associated
condition. This may be K.P. or it may be S.P. or any other
combination which would include the subluxation for condition.</p>

<p>Excellent results are obtained in cases of convulsions. The
adjustment should be given as soon as possible. In many
cases an adjustment of the atlas or axis will bring the child
to consciousness and prevent a recurrence of the attack. The
convulsion may be caused by an atlas subluxation with no
accompanying condition. This is known as a direct convulsion
and will respond very quickly to an adjustment.</p>


<h3 class="center no-indent">NOCTURNAL ENURESIS</h3>

<p>As early as the tenth or twelfth month of age the child
may be trained to make known his desire to empty the bladder.
However, with some children this may not be accomplished
until two and a half years of age. If by the third year of
age the child is unable to retain the urine for a normal length
of time, it is evidence of some abnormality and should receive
Chiropractic attention. The child is afflicted with what is
known as enuresis, which may take place during the day or
night, or both. If it occurs during the day, it is called diurnal;
while if it takes place during the night, it is known as nocturnal.
It is more likely to take place during the night, since
it may be possible for the child to control the bladder during
waking hours.</p>

<p>We are most concerned with the nocturnal enuresis, because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</span>
this form causes the child more discomfort and it is
more difficult to control than the diurnal.</p>

<p>We recognize nocturnal enuresis as an adaptative condition.
That is, the emptying of the bladder is a perfectly
natural process and will always take place under certain conditions.
For example, if the sphincter muscle relaxes, the
urine will be voided. In this event, we are not concerned
in the voiding of the urine, but in the cause for the relaxation
of muscle which prevented the bladder from retaining the
urine. There are a number of conditions to which nocturnal
enuresis is adaptative. The following are the most common:</p>

<p>Incoördinations involving the nervous system.</p>

<p>Highly acid urine.</p>

<p>Excessive quantity of urine.</p>

<p>Abnormalities and incoördinations of the bladder.</p>

<p>Irritation of the genital organs.</p>


<h3>Incoördinations of the Nervous System</h3>

<p>The incoördinations of the nervous system in which there
may be nocturnal enuresis are those commonly found in extremely
neurotic children, and children who are under-nourished
and anemic. Chorea, neurasthenia and hysteria are
examples of conditions in which nocturnal enuresis is very
common. Nervous children are easily disturbed during sleep
and are prone to dream, at such times the innate interpretation
of the vibrations produced by the urine in the bladder
reaches the educated mind and there is not sufficient reasoning
of the conscious mind to enable the child to realize where he
is or to prevent the following of the natural desire to urinate.</p>

<p>The inability of the child to control the bladder during
acute illness must not be mistaken for habitual nocturnal
enuresis; for this will be only temporary, and will disappear
when the child recovers from the acute attack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</span></p>


<h3>Highly Acid Urine</h3>

<p>In some cases, the urine being highly acid, produces vibrations
in the bladder which results in Innate Intelligence causing
the sphincter muscle to relax, which results in the voiding
of the urine. This is an adaptative action on the part of
Innate to prevent the acidity of the urine from setting up
an irritation in the bladder. If the urine remained in the
bladder it would damage the tissues and call for an expenditure
of energy for reparation; this is all prevented by getting
the urine out of the bladder as soon as possible. The hyperacidity
of the urine is the result of the lack of the expression
of mental impulses in the body and should receive immediate
attention, that the cause of the incoördination may be removed.
When this is accomplished the nocturnal enuresis will cease.</p>


<h3>Excessive Quantity of Urine</h3>

<p>In some incoördinations there is abnormal thirst which
results in the child drinking more water than is required for
the normal bodily processes. The natural channel through
which this excessive amount of water is excreted is through
the kidneys. This results in the bladder being filled often,
which necessitates the frequent passing of urine. The child
might be able to control the bladder during waking hours
and make his wants known; but in sleep, as the bladder becomes
full, Innate would relax the sphincter muscle, which
would allow the urine to escape in order to relieve the pressure.
To overcome the nocturnal enuresis in a case of this kind,
it is necessary to adjust for the cause of the excessive thirst;
and when this is corrected, the bed wetting will cease.</p>


<h3>Incoördinations of the Bladder</h3>

<p>Abnormal conditions of the bladder will cause difficulty
in retaining the urine for a normal length of time. An
inflammation of the bladder is greatly exaggerated by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</span>
presence of urine, therefore an irritation would be set up which
would result in a desire to empty the bladder. This would
invariably result in nocturnal enuresis. An interference with
the transmission of motor mental impulses to the sphincter
muscle would be another cause for bed wetting. In this case,
it would be impossible to retain the urine after a certain
amount had passed into the bladder. This would result in
enuresis, since there would be nothing to prevent the urine
from passing freely from the bladder.</p>


<h3>Irritation of the Genital Organs</h3>

<p>In some cases there is an irritation of the genital organs
resulting in the production of vibrations which, when the child
is asleep, results in enuresis. This irritation may be produced
by an adherent prepuce. Balanitis and phimosis are also quite
common conditions. There may be an irritation of the rectum
produced by pin-worms. Vaginal irritation may be the result
of vulvovaginitis, or due to adherent clitoris.</p>


<h3>Correction of the Condition</h3>

<p>It is asserted by some that nocturnal enuresis in many
cases is due largely to habit. We see no more reason for
considering this condition a habit than for considering any
other abnormal condition a habit. It is the result of interference
with the transmission of mental impulses, and it is
the duty of the chiropractor to find the condition to which
nocturnal enuresis is adaptative and correct the cause of that
condition.</p>

<p>Some parents have the idea that bed wetting is a habit,
and the child should be punished in an effort to break him
of the habit. This, however, is the wrong attitude and no
good will be accomplished in this manner. Punishment will
only tend to make the child nervous and the condition worse.</p>

<p>This condition yields so easily to Chiropractic adjustments
that there is no reason for allowing a child to continue without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</span>
relief from this most annoying condition. We have never seen
a case that did not respond to adjustments after the proper
analysis was obtained.</p>

<p>In analyzing a care of nocturnal enuresis it must not be
taken for granted that the major is K.P., or even a lumbar.
For this may not be true. A most thorough analysis should
be made to determine the exact condition of the child. If the
nervous system is involved, there will likely be found an atlas
or axis subluxation. We have seen many cases that had been
adjusted persistently at K.P. and a lumbar, but with no results,
while an adjustment of the axis would get almost immediate
results. This does not mean that every stubborn case will
respond to an axis adjustment.</p>

<p>Scanty and highly colored urine, which has a tendency to
scale and irritate the skin, usually indicates highly acid urine.
In this case a careful analysis must be made to determine the
cause of the acidity. The palpation will reveal a subluxation
and most likely a hot box at C.P. and K.P. In many cases
the child will be anemic, and in a general rundown condition;
in this case the combination will be S.P. and K.P.; the combination
may also include a lumbar.</p>

<p>In the cases involving the bladder, the major will be a
lumbar vertebra. The combination will be determined by the
local condition, which may necessitate the use of K.P. When
there is an irritation of the genital organs or adjacent structures,
the major will include a lower lumbar vertebra and
may or may not require a K.P., the combination depending
upon the character of the local condition.</p>

<p>From the foregoing it will be observed that the major
for nocturnal enuresis varies, depending upon the condition to
which it is adaptative. The major may include At., Ax., C.P.,
K.P., lumbar, or any combination of these or other subluxations.
When the impingements are found, and the causative
subluxations adjusted, complete results will be obtained—in
every case.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</span></p>


<h3 class="center no-indent">OPHTHALMIA</h3>

<p>This is an incoördination characterized by inflammation
of the conjunctiva. It is also called purulent conjunctivitis.
Medically these cases are supposed to be produced by gonorrhea,
although in many of the milder forms the gonococcus
is not present. This is evidence that the cause is not the
gonococcus but that the germs, when present, are there because
of the pathological condition of the tissues.</p>


<h3>Symptoms</h3>

<p>The eyelids are swollen, there is a copious, purulent discharge,
and there may be ulceration of the eyelids.</p>


<h3>Major Adjustment</h3>

<p>The major for this condition is a combination major which
includes a middle or upper cervical for the location and kidney
place for elimination.</p>


<h3 class="center no-indent">TETANUS IN INFANTS</h3>

<p>This is a condition which is occasionally found in young
infants and is the result of an infection usually of the umbilical
wound. It is most prevalent where conditions are unsanitary.
Tetanus is characterized by a tonic spasm of the muscles. It
may affect all the muscles of the body or it may be limited
to the muscles of the jaw, producing what is known as trismus
or lockjaw.</p>


<h3>Symptoms</h3>

<p>The first symptom to appear may be the spasm in the
masseter muscle which interferes with nursing the child. The
muscle of the face and jaws appear firm and hot and the lips
slightly protrude. Intervals will occur when the muscles will
be completely relaxed. At first these paroxysms appear at
intervals, between which the relaxation is complete; but later<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</span>
they become more frequent and the relaxations less marked
until there is more or less of a continuous rigidity. This contraction
grows more exaggerated until the entire body becomes
rigid. The jaws become set and may be separated only
slightly, if at all. There is a peculiar characteristic facial
expression due to the contraction of the facial muscles. Swallowing
becomes very difficult. There is a weak, rapid pulse.
In the mild cases there is only a slight temperature, but in
the more severe cases the temperature may become extremely
high. The cry becomes weak and whining. The incoördination
is of short duration. The child soon dies from exhaustion
or from suffocation due to the rigidity of the respiratory
muscles or it may be due to a spasm of the larynx. While
tetanus is not a very common incoördination, the mortality
is very high. Authorities place the fatality as high as 90%
and even 95%.</p>


<h3>Equation and Family</h3>

<p>The equation is excretion minus (E-). The family is
poison and contractures.</p>


<h3>Major Adjustment</h3>

<p>If these cases are adjusted at an early stage excellent
results will be obtained. There is a combination major at
At.P., C.P., and K.P.</p>


<h3 class="center no-indent">PEMPHIGUS NEONATORUM</h3>

<p>This is a rather unusual condition seldom found in general
practice. It usually occurs as epidemics in institutions where
large numbers of children are cared for. Outside of such
institutions it is more common among children in unhygienic
surroundings. It is characterized by an eruption of blebs
containing a serous fluid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</span></p>


<h3>Symptoms</h3>

<p>These blebs appear about the third or fourth day and may
be found upon any part of the body, but usually upon the
exposed parts. They remain for a time and then rupture or
dry up. There is no suppuration. As the blebs enlarge they
sometimes coalesce, covering quite a large area. The epidermis
is loosened by a serous exudate which occurs directly beneath
it and separates it from the true skin. The case produces a
very striking picture having the appearance of being extensively
burned. After the blebs have ruptured the epidermis
hangs in shreds, leaving a very bright red surface beneath.
In this way there may be large areas of the body almost
completely denuded of the epidermis. There may be a very
slight temperature and slight restlessness. There is great
depression and marked weakness. The symptoms at first
appear rather slowly, later the dis-ease progresses very rapidly,
death often occurring in from twenty-four to forty-eight hours.
Pemphigus neonatorum should be distinguished from congenital
syphilis. The liver and spleen are usually very greatly
enlarged in syphilitic cases and there are usually other characteristic
symptoms present, such as changes in the nails,
mucous membrane and other parts.</p>


<h3>Equation and Family</h3>

<p>The general equation is excretion minus (E-). The condition
is in the poison and fever families.</p>


<h3>Major Adjustment</h3>

<p>The major adjustment is C.P. and K.P.</p>
